Thank you so much, Chris. 
And it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice; I'm extremely grateful. 
I have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night. 
And I say that sincerely, partly because (Mock sob) I need that. 
(Laughter) Put yourselves in my position. 
(Laughter) I flew on Air Force Two for eight years. 
(Laughter) Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane! 
(Laughter) (Applause) I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me. 
(Laughter) It's a true story -- every bit of this is true. 
Soon after Tipper and I left the -- (Mock sob) White House -- (Laughter) we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville. 
Driving ourselves. 
(Laughter) I know it sounds like a little thing to you, but -- (Laughter) I looked in the rear-view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me. 
There was no motorcade back there. 
(Laughter) You've heard of phantom limb pain? 
(Laughter) This was a rented Ford Taurus. 
(Laughter) It was dinnertime, and we started looking for a place to eat. 
We were on I-40. 
We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee. 
We got off the exit, we found a Shoney's restaurant. 
Low-cost family restaurant chain, for those of you who don't know it. 
We went in and sat down at the booth, and the waitress came over, made a big commotion over Tipper. 
(Laughter) She took our order, and then went to the couple in the booth next to us, and she lowered her voice so much, I had to really strain to hear what she was saying. 
And she said "Yes, that's former Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper." 
And the man said, "He's come down a long way, hasn't he?" 
(Laughter) (Applause) There's been kind of a series of epiphanies. 
(Laughter) The very next day, continuing the totally true story, I got on a G-V to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria, in the city of Lagos, on the topic of energy. 
And I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville. 
And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you: Tipper and I were driving ourselves, Shoney's, low-cost family restaurant chain, what the man said -- they laughed. 
I gave my speech, then went back out to the airport to fly back home. 
I fell asleep on the plane until, during the middle of the night, we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling. 
I woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air, and I looked, and there was a man running across the runway. 
And he was waving a piece of paper, and he was yelling, "Call Washington! Call Washington!" 
And I thought to myself, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be wrong in Washington? 
Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things. 
(Laughter) But what it turned out to be, was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech, and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America. 
It was printed in Monterey, I checked. 
(Laughter) And the story began, "Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday," quote: 'My wife Tipper and I have opened a low-cost family restaurant'" -- (Laughter) "'named Shoney's, and we are running it ourselves.'" (Laughter) Before I could get back to U.S. soil, David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on -- one of them had me in a big white chef's hat, Tipper was saying, "One more burger with fries!" 
(Laughter) Three days later, I got a nice, long, handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton, saying, "Congratulations on the new restaurant, Al!" 
(Laughter) We like to celebrate each other's successes in life. 
(Laughter) I was going to talk about information ecology. 
But I was thinking that, since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED, that maybe I could talk about that another time. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: It's a deal! 
(Applause) Al Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on: What can you do about the climate crisis? 
I want to start with a couple of -- I'm going to show some new images, and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five. 
Now, the slide show. 
I update the slide show every time I give it. 
I add new images, because I learn more about it every time I give it. 
It's like beach-combing, you know? 
Every time the tide comes in and out, you find some more shells. 
Just in the last two days, we got the new temperature records in January. 
This is just for the United States of America. 
Historical average for Januarys is 31 degrees; last month was 39.5 degrees. 
Now, I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment -- I'm kidding. 
But these are the recapitulation slides, and then I'm going to go into new material about what you can do. 
But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these. 
First of all, this is where we're projected to go with the U.S. contribution to global warming, under business as usual. 
Efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit. 
Efficiency and conservation -- it's not a cost; it's a profit. 
The sign is wrong. 
It's not negative; it's positive. 
These are investments that pay for themselves. 
But they are also very effective in deflecting our path. 
Cars and trucks -- I talked about that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective. 
It's an easy, visible target of concern -- and it should be -- but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. 
Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest standards in the world. 
And so we should address that. But it's part of the puzzle. 
Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks. 
Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference. 
And with what Vinod, and John Doerr and others, many of you here -- there are a lot of people directly involved in this -- this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it. 
Carbon Capture and Sequestration -- that's what CCS stands for -- is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe. 
Not quite there yet. 
OK. Now, what can you do? 
Reduce emissions in your home. 
Most of these expenditures are also profitable. 
Insulation, better design. 
Buy green electricity where you can. 
I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid. 
Use light rail. 
Figure out some of the other options that are much better. 
It's important. 
Be a green consumer. 
You have choices with everything you buy, between things that have a harsh effect, or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis. 
Consider this: Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life. 
Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people. 
It is easier than you think. 
It really is. 
A lot of us in here have made that decision, and it is really pretty easy. 
It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make, and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced. 
And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net. 
There is a carbon calculator. 
Participant Productions convened -- with my active involvement -- the leading software writers in the world, on this arcane science of carbon calculation, to construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculator. 
You can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce. 
And by the time the movie comes out in May, this will be updated to 2.0, and we will have click-through purchases of offsets. 
Next, consider making your business carbon-neutral. 
Again, some of us have done that, and it's not as hard as you think. 
Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology, or entertainment, or design and architecture community. 
Invest sustainably. 
Majora mentioned this. 
Listen, if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance, don't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management. 
Over time, people do what you pay them to do. 
And if they judge how much they're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested, based on the short-term returns, you're going to get short-term decisions. 
A lot more to be said about that. 
Become a catalyst of change. 
Teach others, learn about it, talk about it. 
The movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertaining. 
And it comes out in May. 
Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it. 
Consider sending somebody to Nashville. 
Pick well. 
And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow -- re-purposed, with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and it's not just the slides, it's what they mean. 
And it's how they link together. 
And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge. 
Working with Larry Lessig, it will be, somewhere in that process, posted with tools and limited-use copyrights, so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way. 
(Applause) Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm's length from politics? 
It doesn't mean that if you're a Republican, that I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat. 
We need Republicans as well. 
This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that in this group it really is. 
Become politically active. 
Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work. 
Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions -- global warming pollution -- and trading it. 
Here's why: as long as the United States is out of the world system, it's not a closed system. 
Once it becomes a closed system, with U.S. participation, then everybody who's on a board of directors -- how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation? 
Once it's a closed system, you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided. 
The market will work to solve this problem -- if we can accomplish this. 
Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring. 
We have to change the minds of the American people. 
Because presently, the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done. 
And in our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did. 
It's now repetition of short, hot-button, 30-second, 28-second television ads. 
We have to buy a lot of those ads. 
Let's re-brand global warming, as many of you have suggested. 
I like "climate crisis" instead of "climate collapse," but again, those of you who are good at branding, I need your help on this. 
Somebody said the test we're facing now, a scientist told me, is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination. 
(Laughter) That's really true. 
I said the other night, and I'll repeat now: this is not a political issue. 
Again, the Republicans here -- this shouldn't be partisan. 
You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do. 
This is an opportunity. 
Not just this, but connected to the ideas that are here, to bring more coherence to them. 
We are one. 
Thank you very much, I appreciate it. 
(Applause) 

With all the legitimate concerns about AIDS and avian flu -- and we'll hear about that from the brilliant Dr. Brilliant later today -- I want to talk about the other pandemic, which is cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension -- all of which are completely preventable for at least 95 percent of people just by changing diet and lifestyle. 
And what's happening is that there's a globalization of illness occurring, that people are starting to eat like us, and live like us, and die like us. And in one generation, for example, Asia's gone from having one of the lowest rates of heart disease and obesity and diabetes to one of the highest. And in Africa, cardiovascular disease equals the HIV and AIDS deaths in most countries. 
So there's a critical window of opportunity we have to make an important difference that can affect the lives of literally millions of people, and practice preventive medicine on a global scale. 
Heart and blood vessel diseases still kill more people -- not only in this country, but also worldwide -- than everything else combined, and yet it's completely preventable for almost everybody. 
It's not only preventable; it's actually reversible. And for the last almost 29 years, we've been able to show that by simply changing diet and lifestyle, using these very high-tech, expensive, state-of-the-art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost interventions can be like -- quantitative arteriography, before and after a year, and cardiac PET scans. 
We showed a few months ago -- we published the first study showing you can actually stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by making changes in diet and lifestyle, and 70 percent regression in the tumor growth, or inhibition of the tumor growth, compared to only nine percent in the control group. 
And in the MRI and MR spectroscopy here, the prostate tumor activity is shown in red -- you can see it diminishing after a year. 
Now there is an epidemic of obesity: two-thirds of adults and 15 percent of kids. What's really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased 70 percent in the past 10 years, and this may be the first generation in which our kids live a shorter life span than we do. That's pitiful, and it's preventable. 
Now these are not election returns, these are the people -- the number of the people who are obese by state, beginning in '85, '86, '87 -- these are from the CDC website -- '88, '89, '90, '91 -- you get a new category -- '92, '93, '94, '95, '96, '97, '98, '99, 2000, 2001 -- it gets worse. We're kind of devolving. (Laughter) Now what can we do about this? Well, you know, the diet that we've found that can reverse heart disease and cancer is an Asian diet. 
But the people in Asia are starting to eat like we are, which is why they're starting to get sick like we are. 
So I've been working with a lot of the big food companies. They can make it fun and sexy and hip and crunchy and convenient to eat healthier foods, like -- I chair the advisory boards to McDonald's, and PepsiCo, and ConAgra, and Safeway, and soon Del Monte, and they're finding that it's good business. 
The salads that you see at McDonald's came from the work -- they're going to have an Asian salad. At Pepsi, two-thirds of their revenue growth came from their better foods. 
And so if we can do that, then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating AIDS and HIV and malaria and for preventing avian flu. Thank you. 

I have a doppelganger. 
(Laughter) Dr. Gero is a brilliant but slightly mad scientist in the "Dragonball Z: Android Saga." 
If you look very carefully, you see that his skull has been replaced with a transparent Plexiglas dome so that the workings of his brain can be observed and also controlled with light. 
That's exactly what I do -- optical mind control. 
(Laughter) But in contrast to my evil twin who lusts after world domination, my motives are not sinister. 
I control the brain in order to understand how it works. 
Now wait a minute, you may say, how can you go straight to controlling the brain without understanding it first? 
Isn't that putting the cart before the horse? 
Many neuroscientists agree with this view and think that understanding will come from more detailed observation and analysis. 
They say, "If we could record the activity of our neurons, we would understand the brain." 
But think for a moment what that means. 
Even if we could measure what every cell is doing at all times, we would still have to make sense of the recorded activity patterns, and that's so difficult, chances are we'll understand these patterns just as little as the brains that produce them. 
Take a look at what brain activity might look like. 
In this simulation, each black dot is one nerve cell. 
The dot is visible whenever a cell fires an electrical impulse. 
There's 10,000 neurons here. 
So you're looking at roughly one percent of the brain of a cockroach. 
Your brains are about 100 million times more complicated. 
Somewhere, in a pattern like this, is you, your perceptions, your emotions, your memories, your plans for the future. 
But we don't know where, since we don't know how to read the pattern. 
We don't understand the code used by the brain. 
To make progress, we need to break the code. 
But how? 
An experienced code-breaker will tell you that in order to figure out what the symbols in a code mean, it's essential to be able to play with them, to rearrange them at will. 
So in this situation too, to decode the information contained in patterns like this, watching alone won't do. 
We need to rearrange the pattern. 
In other words, instead of recording the activity of neurons, we need to control it. 
It's not essential that we can control the activity of all neurons in the brain, just some. 
The more targeted our interventions, the better. 
And I'll show you in a moment how we can achieve the necessary precision. 
And since I'm realistic, rather than grandiose, I don't claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system will at once unravel all its mysteries. 
But we'll certainly learn a lot. 
Now, I'm by no means the first person to realize how powerful a tool intervention is. 
The history of attempts to tinker with the function of the nervous system is long and illustrious. 
It dates back at least 200 years, to Galvani's famous experiments in the late 18th century and beyond. 
Galvani showed that a frog's legs twitched when he connected the lumbar nerve to a source of electrical current. 
This experiment revealed the first, and perhaps most fundamental, nugget of the neural code: that information is written in the form of electrical impulses. 
Galvani's approach of probing the nervous system with electrodes has remained state-of-the-art until today, despite a number of drawbacks. 
Sticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude. 
It's hard to do in animals that run around, and there is a physical limit to the number of wires that can be inserted simultaneously. 
So around the turn of the last century, I started to think, "Wouldn't it be wonderful if one could take this logic and turn it upside down?" 
So instead of inserting a wire into one spot of the brain, re-engineer the brain itself so that some of its neural elements become responsive to diffusely broadcast signals such as a flash of light. 
Such an approach would literally, in a flash of light, overcome many of the obstacles to discovery. 
First, it's clearly a non-invasive, wireless form of communication. 
And second, just as in a radio broadcast, you can communicate with many receivers at once. 
You don't need to know where these receivers are, and it doesn't matter if these receivers move -- just think of the stereo in your car. 
It gets even better, for it turns out that we can fabricate the receivers out of materials that are encoded in DNA. 
So each nerve cell with the right genetic makeup will spontaneously produce a receiver that allows us to control its function. 
I hope you'll appreciate the beautiful simplicity of this concept. 
There's no high-tech gizmos here, just biology revealed through biology. 
Now let's take a look at these miraculous receivers up close. 
As we zoom in on one of these purple neurons, we see that its outer membrane is studded with microscopic pores. 
Pores like these conduct electrical current and are responsible for all the communication in the nervous system. 
But these pores here are special. 
They are coupled to light receptors similar to the ones in your eyes. 
Whenever a flash of light hits the receptor, the pore opens, an electrical current is switched on, and the neuron fires electrical impulses. 
Because the light-activated pore is encoded in DNA, we can achieve incredible precision. 
This is because, although each cell in our bodies contains the same set of genes, different mixes of genes get turned on and off in different cells. 
You can exploit this to make sure that only some neurons contain our light-activated pore and others don't. 
So in this cartoon, the bluish white cell in the upper-left corner does not respond to light because it lacks the light-activated pore. 
The approach works so well that we can write purely artificial messages directly to the brain. 
In this example, each electrical impulse, each deflection on the trace, is caused by a brief pulse of light. 
And the approach, of course, also works in moving, behaving animals. 
This is the first ever such experiment, sort of the optical equivalent of Galvani's. 
It was done six or seven years ago by my then graduate student, Susana Lima. 
Susana had engineered the fruit fly on the left so that just two out of the 200,000 cells in its brain expressed the light-activated pore. 
You're familiar with these cells because they are the ones that frustrate you when you try to swat the fly. 
They trained the escape reflex that makes the fly jump into the air and fly away whenever you move your hand in position. 
And you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect. 
The animal jumps, it spreads its wings, it vibrates them, but it can't actually take off because the fly is sandwiched between two glass plates. 
Now to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly to a flash it could see, Susana did a simple but brutally effective experiment. 
She cut the heads off of her flies. 
These headless bodies can live for about a day, but they don't do much. 
They just stand around and groom excessively. 
So it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is vanity. 
(Laughter) Anyway, as you'll see in a moment, Susana was able to turn on the flight motor of what's the equivalent of the spinal cord of these flies and get some of the headless bodies to actually take off and fly away. 
They didn't get very far, obviously. 
Since we took these first steps, the field of optogenetics has exploded. 
And there are now hundreds of labs using these approaches. 
And we've come a long way since Galvani's and Susana's first successes in making animals twitch or jump. 
We can now actually interfere with their psychology in rather profound ways, as I'll show you in my last example, which is directed at a familiar question. 
Life is a string of choices creating a constant pressure to decide what to do next. 
We cope with this pressure by having brains, and within our brains, decision-making centers that I've called here the "Actor." 
The Actor implements a policy that takes into account the state of the environment and the context in which we operate. 
Our actions change the environment, or context, and these changes are then fed back into the decision loop. 
Now to put some neurobiological meat on this abstract model, we constructed a simple one-dimensional world for our favorite subject, fruit flies. 
Each chamber in these two vertical stacks contains one fly. 
The left and the right halves of the chamber are filled with two different odors, and a security camera watches as the flies pace up and down between them. 
Here's some such CCTV footage. 
Whenever a fly reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odor streams meet, it has to make a decision. 
It has to decide whether to turn around and stay in the same odor, or whether to cross the midline and try something new. 
These decisions are clearly a reflection of the Actor's policy. 
Now for an intelligent being like our fly, this policy is not written in stone but rather changes as the animal learns from experience. 
We can incorporate such an element of adaptive intelligence into our model by assuming that the fly's brain contains not only an Actor, but a different group of cells, a "Critic," that provides a running commentary on the Actor's choices. 
You can think of this nagging inner voice as sort of the brain's equivalent of the Catholic Church, if you're an Austrian like me, or the super-ego, if you're Freudian, or your mother, if you're Jewish. 
(Laughter) Now obviously, the Critic is a key ingredient in what makes us intelligent. 
So we set out to identify the cells in the fly's brain that played the role of the Critic. 
And the logic of our experiment was simple. 
We thought if we could use our optical remote control to activate the cells of the Critic, we should be able, artificially, to nag the Actor into changing its policy. 
In other words, the fly should learn from mistakes that it thought it had made but, in reality, it had not made. 
So we bred flies whose brains were more or less randomly peppered with cells that were light addressable. 
And then we took these flies and allowed them to make choices. 
And whenever they made one of the two choices, chose one odor, in this case the blue one over the orange one, we switched on the lights. 
If the Critic was among the optically activated cells, the result of this intervention should be a change in policy. 
The fly should learn to avoid the optically reinforced odor. 
Here's what happened in two instances: We're comparing two strains of flies, each of them having about 100 light-addressable cells in their brains, shown here in green on the left and on the right. 
What's common among these groups of cells is that they all produce the neurotransmitter dopamine. 
But the identities of the individual dopamine-producing neurons are clearly largely different on the left and on the right. 
Optically activating these hundred or so cells into two strains of flies has dramatically different consequences. 
If you look first at the behavior of the fly on the right, you can see that whenever it reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odors meet, it marches straight through, as it did before. 
Its behavior is completely unchanged. 
But the behavior of the fly on the left is very different. 
Whenever it comes up to the midpoint, it pauses, it carefully scans the odor interface as if it was sniffing out its environment, and then it turns around. 
This means that the policy that the Actor implements now includes an instruction to avoid the odor that's in the right half of the chamber. 
This means that the Critic must have spoken in that animal, and that the Critic must be contained among the dopamine-producing neurons on the left, but not among the dopamine producing neurons on the right. 
Through many such experiments, we were able to narrow down the identity of the Critic to just 12 cells. 
These 12 cells, as shown here in green, send the output to a brain structure called the "mushroom body," which is shown here in gray. 
We know from our formal model that the brain structure at the receiving end of the Critic's commentary is the Actor. 
So this anatomy suggests that the mushroom bodies have something to do with action choice. 
Based on everything we know about the mushroom bodies, this makes perfect sense. 
In fact, it makes so much sense that we can construct an electronic toy circuit that simulates the behavior of the fly. 
In this electronic toy circuit, the mushroom body neurons are symbolized by the vertical bank of blue LEDs in the center of the board. 
These LED's are wired to sensors that detect the presence of odorous molecules in the air. 
Each odor activates a different combination of sensors, which in turn activates a different odor detector in the mushroom body. 
So the pilot in the cockpit of the fly, the Actor, can tell which odor is present simply by looking at which of the blue LEDs lights up. 
What the Actor does with this information depends on its policy, which is stored in the strengths of the connection, between the odor detectors and the motors that power the fly's evasive actions. 
If the connection is weak, the motors will stay off and the fly will continue straight on its course. 
If the connection is strong, the motors will turn on and the fly will initiate a turn. 
Now consider a situation in which the motors stay off, the fly continues on its path and it suffers some painful consequence such as getting zapped. 
In a situation like this, we would expect the Critic to speak up and to tell the Actor to change its policy. 
We have created such a situation, artificially, by turning on the critic with a flash of light. 
That caused a strengthening of the connections between the currently active odor detector and the motors. 
So the next time the fly finds itself facing the same odor again, the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors and to trigger an evasive maneuver. 
I don't know about you, but I find it exhilarating to see how vague psychological notions evaporate and give rise to a physical, mechanistic understanding of the mind, even if it's the mind of the fly. 
This is one piece of good news. 
The other piece of good news, for a scientist at least, is that much remains to be discovered. 
In the experiments I told you about, we have lifted the identity of the Critic, but we still have no idea how the Critic does its job. 
Come to think of it, knowing when you're wrong without a teacher, or your mother, telling you, is a very hard problem. 
There are some ideas in computer science and in artificial intelligence as to how this might be done, but we still haven't solved a single example of how intelligent behavior springs from the physical interactions in living matter. 
I think we'll get there in the not too distant future. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Well, there's lots to talk about, but I think I'm just going to play to start off. 
(Music) ♫ When I wake up ♫ ♫ in the morning ♫ ♫ I pour the coffee ♫ ♫ I read the paper ♫ ♫ And then I slowly ♫ ♫ and so softly ♫ ♫ do the dishes ♫ ♫ So feed the fishes ♫ ♫ You sing me happy birthday ♫ ♫ Like it's gonna be ♫ ♫ your last day ♫ ♫ here on Earth ♫ (Applause) All right. 
So, I wanted to do something special today. 
I want to debut a new song that I've been working on in the last five or six months. 
And there's few things more thrilling than playing a song for the first time in front of an audience, especially when it's half-finished. 
(Laughter) I'm kind of hoping some conversations here might help me finish it. 
Because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms. 
And so this is basically a song about loops, but not the kind of loops that I make up here. 
They're feedback loops. 
And in the audio world that's when the microphone gets too close to its sound source, and then it gets in this self-destructive loop that creates a very unpleasant sound. 
And I'm going to demonstrate for you. 
(Laughter) I'm not going to hurt you. Don't worry. 
♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a -- (Feedback) All right. I don't know if that was necessary to demonstrate -- (Laughter) -- but my point is it's the sound of self-destruction. 
And I've been thinking about how that applies across a whole spectrum of realms, from, say, the ecological, okay. 
There seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from, it gets ugly. 
So like, you can't feed cows their own brains or you get mad cow disease, and inbreeding and incest and, let's see, what's the other one? 
Biological -- there's autoimmune diseases, where the body attacks itself a little too overzealously and destroys the host, or the person. 
And then -- okay, this is where we get to the song -- kind of bridges the gap to the emotional. 
Because although I've used scientific terms in songs, it's very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical. 
And there's some things you just don't need to have in songs. 
So I'm trying to bridge this gap between this idea and this melody. 
And so, I don't know if you've ever had this, but when I close my eyes sometimes and try to sleep, I can't stop thinking about my own eyes. 
And it's like your eyes start straining to see themselves. 
That's what it feels like to me. 
It's not pleasant. 
I'm sorry if I put that idea in your head. 
(Laughter) It's impossible, of course, for your eyes to see themselves, but they seem to be trying. 
So that's getting a little more closer to a personal experience. 
Or ears being able to hear themselves -- it's just impossible. 
That's the thing. 
So, I've been working on this song that mentions these things and then also imagines a person who's been so successful at defending themselves from heartbreak that they're left to do the deed themselves, if that's possible. 
And that's what the song is asking. 
All right. 
It doesn't have a name yet. 
(Music) ♫ Go ahead and congratulate yourself ♫ ♫ Give yourself a hand, the hand is your hand ♫ ♫ And the eye that eyes itself is your eye ♫ ♫ And the ear that hears itself is near ♫ ♫ 'Cause it's your ear, oh oh ♫ ♫ You've done the impossible now ♫ ♫ Took yourself apart ♫ ♫ You made yourself invulnerable ♫ ♫ No one can break your heart ♫ ♫ So you wear it out ♫ ♫ And you wring it out ♫ ♫ And you wear it out ♫ ♫ And you break it yourself ♫ ♫ Breaking your own, break it yourself ♫ ♫ Breaking your own, break it yourself ♫ ♫ Breaking your own ♫ (Applause) Thanks. 
(Applause) All right. 
It's kind of cool. Songwriters can sort of get away with murder. 
You can throw out crazy theories and not have to back it up with data or graphs or research. 
But, you know, I think reckless curiosity would be what the world needs now, just a little bit. 
(Applause) I'm going to finish up with a song of mine called "Weather Systems." 
(Music) ♫ Quiet ♫ ♫ Quiet down, she said ♫ ♫ Speak into the back of his head ♫ ♫ On the edge of the bed, I can see your blood flow ♫ ♫ I can see your ♫ ♫ cells grow ♫ ♫ Hold still awhile ♫ ♫ Don't spill the wine ♫ ♫ I can see it all from here ♫ ♫ I can see ♫ ♫ oh, I ♫ ♫ I can see ♫ ♫ weather systems ♫ ♫ of the world ♫ ♫ Weather systems ♫ ♫ of the world ♫ ♫ Some things you say ♫ ♫ are not for sale ♫ ♫ I would hold it where ♫ ♫ our free agents of some substance are ♫ ♫ scared ♫ ♫ Hold still a while ♫ ♫ Don't spill the wine ♫ ♫ I can see it all from here ♫ ♫ I can see ♫ ♫ oh, I ♫ ♫ I can see ♫ ♫ weather systems of the world ♫ ♫ Weather systems ♫ ♫ of the world ♫ Thanks. 
(Applause) 

So this is a story of a place that I now call home. 
It's a story of public education and of rural communities and of what design might do to improve both. 
So this is Bertie County, North Carolina, USA. 
To give you an idea of the "where:" So here's North Carolina, and if we zoom in, Bertie County is in the eastern part of the state. 
It's about two hours east driving-time from Raleigh. 
And it's very flat. It's very swampy. 
It's mostly farmland. 
The entire county is home to just 20,000 people, and they're very sparsely distributed. 
So there's only 27 people per square mile, which comes down to about 10 people per square kilometer. 
Bertie County is kind of a prime example in the demise of rural America. 
We've seen this story all over the country and even in places beyond the American borders. 
We know the symptoms. 
It's the hollowing out of small towns. 
It's downtowns becoming ghost towns. 
The brain drain -- where all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back. 
It's the dependence on farm subsidies and under-performing schools and higher poverty rates in rural areas than in urban. 
And Bertie County is no exception to this. 
Perhaps the biggest thing it struggles with, like many communities similar to it, is that there's no shared, collective investment in the future of rural communities. 
Only 6.8 percent of all our philanthropic giving in the U.S. right now benefits rural communities, and yet 20 percent of our population lives there. 
So Bertie County is not only very rural; it's incredibly poor. 
It is the poorest county in the state. 
It has one in three of its children living in poverty, and it's what is referred to as a "rural ghetto." 
The economy is mostly agricultural. 
The biggest crops are cotton and tobacco, and we're very proud of our Bertie County peanut. 
The biggest employer is the Purdue chicken processing plant. 
The county seat is Windsor. 
This is like Times Square of Windsor that you're looking at right now. 
It's home to only 2,000 people, and like a lot of other small towns it has been hollowed out over the years. 
There are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair than occupied and in use. 
You can count the number of restaurants in the county on one hand -- Bunn's Barbecue being my absolute favorite. 
But in the whole county there is no coffee shop, there's no Internet cafe, there's no movie theater, there's no bookstore. 
There isn't even a Walmart. 
Racially, the county is about 60 percent African-American, but what happens in the public schools is most of the privileged white kids go to the private Lawrence Academy. 
So the public school students are about 86 percent African-American. 
And this is a spread from the local newspaper of the recent graduating class, and you can see the difference is pretty stark. 
So to say that the public education system in Bertie County is struggling would be a huge understatement. 
There's basically no pool of qualified teachers to pull from, and only eight percent of the people in the county have a bachelor's degree or higher. 
So there isn't a big legacy in the pride of education. 
In fact, two years ago, only 27 percent of all the third- through eighth-graders were passing the state standard in both English and math. 
So it sounds like I'm painting a really bleak picture of this place, but I promise there is good news. 
The biggest asset, in my opinion, one of the biggest assets in Bertie County right now is this man: This is Dr. Chip Zullinger, fondly known as Dr. Z. 
He was brought in in October 2007 as the new superintendent to basically fix this broken school system. 
And he previously was a superintendent in Charleston, South Carolina and then in Denver, Colorado. 
He started some of the country's first charter schools in the late '80s in the U.S. 
And he is an absolute renegade and a visionary, and he is the reason that I now live and work there. 
So in February of 2009, Dr. Zullinger invited us, Project H Design -- which is a non-profit design firm that I founded -- to come to Bertie and to partner with him on the repair of this school district and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district. 
And he invited us in particular because we have a very specific type of design process -- one that results in appropriate design solutions in places that don't usually have access to design services or creative capital. 
Specifically, we use these six design directives, probably the most important being number two: we design with, not for -- in that, when we're doing humanitarian-focused design, it's not about designing for clients anymore. 
It's about designing with people, and letting appropriate solutions emerge from within. 
So at the time of being invited down there, we were based in San Francisco, and so we were going back and forth for basically the rest of 2009, spending about half our time in Bertie County. 
And when I say we, I mean Project H, but more specifically, I mean myself and my partner, Matthew Miller, who's an architect and a sort of MacGyver-type builder. 
So fast-forward to today, and we now live there. 
I have strategically cut Matt's head out of this photo, because he would kill me if he knew I was using it because of the sweatsuits. 
But this is our front porch. We live there. 
We now call this place home. 
Over the course of this year that we spent flying back and forth, we realized we had fallen in love with the place. 
We had fallen in love with the place and the people and the work that we're able to do in a rural place like Bertie County, that, as designers and builders, you can't do everywhere. 
There's space to experiment and to weld and to test things. 
We have an amazing advocate in Dr. Zullinger. 
There's a nobility of real, hands-on, dirt-under-your-fingernails work. 
But beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there, there is a huge need. 
There is a total vacuum of creative capital in Bertie County. 
There isn't a single licensed architect in the whole county. 
And so we saw an opportunity to bring design as this untouched tool, something that Bertie County didn't otherwise have, and to be sort of the -- to usher that in as a new type of tool in their tool kit. 
The initial goal became using design within the public education system in partnership with Dr. Zullinger -- that was why we were there. 
But beyond that, we recognized that Bertie County, as a community, was in dire need of a fresh perspective of pride and connectedness and of the creative capital that they were so much lacking. 
So the goal became, yes, to apply design within education, but then to figure out how to make education a great vehicle for community development. 
So in order to do this, we've taken three different approaches to the intersection of design and education. 
And I should say that these are three things that we've done in Bertie County, but I feel pretty confident that they could work in a lot of other rural communities around the U.S. and maybe even beyond. 
So the first of the three is design for education. 
This is the most kind of direct, obvious intersection of the two things. 
It's the physical construction of improved spaces and materials and experiences for teachers and students. 
This is in response to the awful mobile trailers and the outdated textbooks and the terrible materials that we're building schools out of these days. 
And so this played out for us in a couple different ways. 
The first was a series of renovations of computer labs. 
So traditionally, the computer labs, particularly in an under-performing school like Bertie County, where they have to benchmark test every other week, the computer lab is a kill-and-drill testing facility. 
You come in, you face the wall, you take your test and you leave. 
So we wanted to change the way that students approach technology, to create a more convivial and social space that was more engaging, more accessible, and also to increase the ability for teachers to use these spaces for technology-based instruction. 
So this is the lab at the high school, and the principal there is in love with this room. 
Every time he has visitors, it's the first place that he takes them. 
And this also meant the co-creation with some teachers of this educational playground system called the learning landscape. 
It allows elementary-level students to learn core subjects through game play and activity and running around and screaming and being a kid. 
So this game that the kids are playing here -- in this case they were learning basic multiplication through a game called Match Me. 
And in Match Me, you take the class, divide it into two teams, one team on each side of the playground, and the teacher will take a piece of chalk and just write a number on each of the tires. 
And then she'll call out a math problem -- so let's say four times four -- and then one student from each team has to compete to figure out that four times four is 16 and find the tire with the 16 on it and sit on it. 
So the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires and then your team wins. 
And the impact of the learning landscape has been pretty surprising and amazing. 
Some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores, a greater comfort level with the material, especially with the boys, that in going outside and playing, they aren't afraid to take on a double-digit multiplication problem -- and also that the teachers are able to use these as assessment tools to better gauge how their students are understanding new material. 
So with design for education, I think the most important thing is to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers, so that they have the incentive and the desire to use them. 
So this is Mr. Perry. He's the assistant superintendent. 
He came out for one of our teacher-training days and won like five rounds of Match Me in a row and was very proud of himself. 
(Laughter) So the second approach is redesigning education itself. 
This is the most complex. 
It's a systems-level look at how education is administered and what is being offered and to whom. 
So in many cases this is not so much about making change as it is creating the conditions under which change is possible and the incentive to want to make change, which is easier said than done in rural communities and in inside-the-box education systems in rural communities. 
So for us, this was a graphic public campaign called Connect Bertie. 
There are thousands of these blue dots all over the county. 
And this was for a fund that the school district had to put a desktop computer and a broadband Internet connection in every home with a child in the public school system. 
Right now I should say, there are only 10 percent of the houses that actually have an in-home Internet connection. 
And the only places to get WiFi are in the school buildings, or at the Bojangles Fried Chicken joint, which I find myself squatting outside of a lot. 
Aside from, you know, getting people excited and wondering what the heck these blue dots were all over the place, it asked the school system to envision how it might become a catalyst for a more connected community. 
It asked them to reach outside of the school walls and to think about how they could play a role in the community's development. 
So the first batch of computers are being installed later this summer, and we're helping Dr. Zullinger develop some strategies around how we might connect the classroom and the home to extend learning beyond the school day. 
And then the third approach, which is what I'm most excited about, which is where we are now, is: design as education. 
So "design as education" means that we could actually teach design within public schools, and not design-based learning -- not like "let's learn physics by building a rocket," but actually learning design-thinking coupled with real construction and fabrication skills put towards a local community purpose. 
It also means that designers are no longer consultants, but we're teachers, and we are charged with growing creative capital within the next generation. 
And what design offers as an educational framework is an antidote to all of the boring, rigid, verbal instruction that so many of these school districts are plagued by. 
It's hands-on, it's in-your-face, it requires an active engagement, and it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning in real ways. 
So we started thinking about the legacy of shop class and how shop class -- wood and metal shop class in particular -- historically, has been something intended for kids who aren't going to go to college. 
It's a vocational training path. 
It's working-class; it's blue-collar. 
The projects are things like, let's make a birdhouse for your mom for Christmas. 
And in recent decades, a lot of the funding for shop class has gone away entirely. 
So we thought, what if you could bring back shop class, but this time orient the projects around things that the community needed, and to infuse shop class with a more critical and creative-design-thinking studio process. 
So we took this kind of nebulous idea and have worked really closely with Dr. Zullinger for the past year on writing this as a one-year curriculum offered at the high school level to the junior class. 
And so this starts in four weeks, at the end of the summer, and my partner and I, Matthew and I, just went through the arduous and totally convoluted process of getting certified as high school teachers to actually run it. 
And this is what it looks like. 
So over the course of two semesters, the Fall and the Spring, the students spend three hours a day every single day in our 4,500 square foot studio/shop space. 
And during that time, they're doing everything from going out and doing ethnographic research and doing the need-finding, coming back into the studio, doing the brainstorming and design visualization to come up with concepts that might work, and then moving into the shop and actually testing them, building them, prototyping them, figuring out if they are going to work and refining that. 
And then over the summer, they're offered a summer job. 
They're paid as employees of Project H to be the construction crew with us to build these projects in the community. 
So the first project, which will be built next summer, is an open-air farmers' market downtown, followed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year and home improvements for the elderly in the third year. 
So these are real visible projects that hopefully the students can point to and say, "I built that, and I'm proud of it." 
So I want you to meet three of our students. 
This is Ryan. 
She is 15 years old. 
She loves agriculture and wants to be a high school teacher. 
She wants to go to college, but she wants to come back to Bertie County, because that's where her family is from, where she calls home, and she feels very strongly about giving back to this place that she's been fairly fortunate in. 
So what Studio H might offer her is a way to develop skills so that she might give back in the most meaningful way. 
This is Eric. He plays for the football team. 
He is really into dirtbike racing, and he wants to be an architect. 
So for him, Studio H offers him a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect, everything from drafting to wood and metal construction to how to do research for a client. 
And then this is Anthony. 
He is 16 years old, loves hunting and fishing and being outside and doing anything with his hands, and so for him, Studio H means that he can stay interested in his education through that hands-on engagement. 
He's interested in forestry, but he isn't sure, so if he ends up not going to college, he will have developed some industry-relevant skills. 
What design and building really offers to public education is a different kind of classroom. 
So this building downtown, which may very well become the site of our future farmers' market, is now the classroom. 
And going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors about what kind of food they buy and from where and why -- that's a homework assignment. 
And the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the end of the summer when they have built the farmers' market and it's open to the public -- that's the final exam. 
And for the community, what design and building offers is real, visible, built progress. 
It's one project per year, and it makes the youth the biggest asset and the biggest untapped resource in imagining a new future. 
So we recognize that Studio H, especially in its first year, is a small story -- 13 students, it's two teachers, it's one project in one place. 
But we feel like this could work in other places. 
And I really, strongly believe in the power of the small story, because it is so difficult to do humanitarian work at a global scale. 
Because, when you zoom out that far, you lose the ability to view people as humans. 
Ultimately, design itself is a process of constant education for the people that we work with and for and for us as designers. 
And let's face it, designers, we need to reinvent ourselves. 
We need to re-educate ourselves around the things that matter, we need to work outside of our comfort zones more, and we need to be better citizens in our own backyard. 
So while this is a very small story, we hope that it represents a step in the right direction for the future of rural communities and for the future of public education and hopefully also for the future of design. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Today I want to talk to you about ethnic conflict and civil war. 
These are not normally the most cheerful of topics, nor do they generally generate the kind of good news that this conference is about. 
Yet, not only is there at least some good news to be told about fewer such conflicts now than two decades ago, but what is perhaps more important is that we also have come to a much better understanding of what can be done to further reduce the number of ethnic conflicts and civil wars and the suffering that they inflict. 
Three things stand out: leadership, diplomacy and institutional design. 
What I will focus on in my talk is why they matter, how they matter, and what we can all do to make sure that they continue to matter in the right ways, that is, how all of us can contribute to developing and honing the skills of local and global leaders to make peace and to make it last. 
But let's start at the beginning. 
Civil wars have made news headlines for many decades now, and ethnic conflicts in particular have been a near constant presence as a major international security threat. 
For nearly two decades now, the news has been bad and the images have been haunting. 
In Georgia, after years of stalemate, we saw a full-scale resurgence of violence in August, 2008. 
This quickly escalated into a five-day war between Russia and Georgia, leaving Georgia ever more divided. 
In Kenya, contested presidential elections in 2007 -- we just heard about them -- quickly led to high levels of inter-ethnic violence and the killing and displacement of thousands of people. 
In Sri Lanka, a decades-long civil war between the Tamil minority and the Sinhala majority led to a bloody climax in 2009, after perhaps as many as 100,000 people had been killed since 1983. 
In Kyrgyzstan, just over the last few weeks, unprecedented levels of violence occurred between ethnic Kyrgyz and ethnic Uzbeks. 
Hundreds have been killed, and more than 100,000 displaced, including many ethnic Uzbeks who fled to neighboring Uzbekistan. 
In the Middle East, conflict between Israelis and Palestinians continues unabated, and it becomes ever more difficult to see how, just how a possible, sustainable solution can be achieved. 
Darfur may have slipped from the news headlines, but the killing and displacement there continues as well, and the sheer human misery that it creates is very hard to fathom. 
And in Iraq, finally, violence is on the rise again, and the country has yet to form a government four months after its last parliamentary elections. 
But hang on, this talk is to be about the good news. 
So are these now the images of the past? 
Well, notwithstanding the gloomy pictures from the Middle East, Darfur, Iraq, elsewhere, there is a longer-term trend that does represent some good news. 
Over the past two decades, since the end of the Cold War, there has been an overall decline in the number of civil wars. 
Since the high in the early 1990s, with about 50 such civil wars ongoing, we now have 30 percent fewer such conflicts today. 
The number of people killed in civil wars also is much lower today than it was a decade ago or two. 
But this trend is less unambiguous. 
The highest level of deaths on the battlefield was recorded between 1998 and 2001, with about 80,000 soldiers, policemen and rebels killed every year. 
The lowest number of combatant casualties occurred in 2003, with just 20,000 killed. 
Despite the up and down since then, the overall trend -- and this is the important bit -- clearly points downward for the past two decades. 
The news about civilian casualties is also less bad than it used to be. 
From over 12,000 civilians deliberately killed in civil wars in 1997 and 1998, a decade later, this figure stands at 4,000. 
This is a decrease by two-thirds. 
This decline would be even more obvious if we factored in the genocide in Rwanda in 1994. 
But then 800,000 civilians were slaughtered in a matter of just a few months. 
This certainly is an accomplishment that must never be surpassed. 
What is also important is to note that these figures only tell part of the story. 
They exclude people that died as a consequence of civil war, from hunger or disease, for example. 
And they also do not properly account for civilian suffering more generally. 
Torture, rape and ethnic cleansing have become highly effective, if often non-lethal, weapons in civil war. 
To put it differently, for the civilians that suffer the consequences of ethnic conflict and civil war, there is no good war and there is no bad peace. 
Thus, even though every civilian killed, maimed, raped, or tortured is one too many, the fact that the number of civilian casualties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago, is good news. 
So, we have fewer conflicts today in which fewer people get killed. 
And the big question, of course, is why? 
In some cases, there is a military victory of one side. 
This is a solution of sorts, but rarely is it one that comes without human costs or humanitarian consequences. 
The defeat of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka is perhaps the most recent example of this, but we have seen similar so-called military solutions in the Balkans, in the South Caucasus and across most of Africa. 
At times, they are complimented by negotiated settlements, or at least cease-fire agreements, and peacekeepers are deployed. 
But hardly ever do they represent a resounding success -- Bosnia and Herzegovina perhaps more so than Georgia. 
But for many parts of Africa, a colleague of mine once put it this way, "The cease-fire on Tuesday night was reached just in time for the genocide to start on Wednesday morning." 
But let's look at the good news again. 
If there's no solution on the battlefield, three factors can account for the prevention of ethnic conflict and civil war, or for sustainable peace afterwards: leadership, diplomacy and institutional design. 
Take the example of Northern Ireland. 
Despite centuries of animosity, decades of violence and thousands of people killed, 1998 saw the conclusion of an historic agreement. 
Its initial version was skillfully mediated by Senator George Mitchell. 
Crucially, for the long-term success of the peace process in Northern Ireland, he imposed very clear conditions for the participation and negotiations. 
Central among them, a commitment to exclusively peaceful means. 
Subsequent revisions of the agreement were facilitated by the British and Irish governments, who never wavered in their determination to bring peace and stability to Northern Ireland. 
The core institutions that were put in place in 1998 and their modifications in 2006 and 2008 were highly innovative and allowed all conflict parties to see their core concerns and demands addressed. 
The agreement combines a power-sharing arrangement in Northern Ireland with cross-border institutions that link Belfast and Dublin and thus recognizes the so-called Irish dimension of the conflict. 
And significantly, there's also a clear focus on both the rights of individuals and the rights of communities. 
The provisions in the agreement may be complex, but so is the underlying conflict. 
Perhaps most importantly, local leaders repeatedly rose to the challenge of compromise, not always fast and not always enthusiastically, but rise in the end they did. 
Who ever could have imagined Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness jointly governing Northern Ireland as First and Deputy First Minister? 
But then, is Northern Ireland a unique example, or does this kind of explanation only hold more generally in democratic and developed countries? 
By no means. 
The ending of Liberia's long-lasting civil war in 2003 illustrates the importance of leadership, diplomacy and institutional design as much as the successful prevention of a full-scale civil war in Macedonia in 2001, or the successful ending of the conflict in Aceh in Indonesia in 2005. 
In all three cases, local leaders were willing and able to make peace, the international community stood ready to help them negotiate and implement an agreement, and the institutions have lived up to the promise that they held on the day they were agreed. 
Focusing on leadership, diplomacy and institutional design also helps explain failures to achieve peace, or to make it last. 
The hopes that were vested in the Oslo Accords did not lead to an end of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. 
Not all the issues that needed to be resolved were actually covered in the agreements. 
Rather, local leaders committed to revisiting them later on. 
Yet instead of grasping this opportunity, local and international leaders soon disengaged and became distracted by the second Intifada, the events of 9/11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
The comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan signed in 2005 turned out to be less comprehensive than envisaged, and its provisions may yet bear the seeds of a full-scale return to war between north and south. 
Changes and shortcomings in leadership, more off than on international diplomacy and institutional failures account for this in almost equal measure. 
Unresolved boundary issues, squabbles over oil revenues, the ongoing conflict in Darfur, escalating tribal violence in the south and generally weak state capacity across all of Sudan complete a very depressing picture of the state of affairs in Africa's largest country. 
A final example: Kosovo. 
The failure to achieve a negotiated solution for Kosovo and the violence, tension and de facto partition that resulted from it have their reasons in many, many different factors. 
Central among them are three. 
First, the intransigence of local leaders to settle for nothing less than their maximum demands. 
Second, an international diplomatic effort that was hampered from the beginning by Western support for Kosovo's independence. 
And third, a lack of imagination when it came to designing institutions that could have addressed the concerns of Serbs and Albanians alike. 
By the same token -- and here we have some good news again -- the very fact that there is a high-level, well-resourced international presence in Kosovo and the Balkans region more generally and the fact that local leaders on both sides have showed relative restraint, explains why things have not been worse over the past two years since 2008. 
So even in situations where outcomes are less than optimal, local leaders and international leaders have a choice, and they can make a difference for the better. 
A cold war is not as good as a cold peace, but a cold peace is still better than a hot war. 
Good news is also about learning the right lesson. 
So what then distinguishes the Israeli/Palestinian conflict from that in Northern Ireland, or the civil war in Sudan from that in Liberia? 
Both successes and failures teach us several critically important things that we need to bear in mind if we want the good news to continue. 
First, leadership. 
In the same way in which ethnic conflict and civil war are not natural but man-made disasters, their prevention and settlement does not happen automatically either. 
Leadership needs to be capable, determined and visionary in its commitment to peace. 
Leaders need to connect to each other and to their followers, and they need to bring them along on what is an often arduous journey into a peaceful future. 
Second, diplomacy. 
Diplomacy needs to be well resourced, sustained, and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures on leaders and followers. 
It needs to help them reach an equitable compromise, and it needs to ensure that a broad coalition of local, regional and international supporters help them implement their agreement. 
Third, institutional design. 
Institutional design requires a keen focus on issues, innovative thinking and flexible and well-funded implementation. 
Conflict parties need to move away from maximum demands and towards a compromise that recognizes each other's needs. 
And they need to think about the substance of their agreement much more than about the labels they want to attach to them. 
Conflict parties also need to be prepared to return to the negotiation table if the agreement implementation stalls. 
For me personally, the most critical lesson of all is this: Local commitment to peace is all-important, but it is often not enough to prevent or end violence. 
Yet, no amount of diplomacy or institutional design can make up for local failures and the consequences that they have. 
Therefore, we must invest in developing leaders, leaders that have the skills, vision and determination to make peace. 
Leaders, in other words, that people will trust and that they will want to follow even if that means making hard choices. 
A final thought: Ending civil wars is a process that is fraught with dangers, frustrations and setbacks. 
It often takes a generation to accomplish, but it also requires us, today's generation, to take responsibility and to learn the right lessons about leadership, diplomacy and institutional design, so that the child soldiers of today can become the children of tomorrow. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I'm here today to show my photographs of the Lakota. 
Many of you may have heard of the Lakota, or at least the larger group of tribes, called the Sioux. 
The Lakota are one of many tribes that were moved off their land to prisoner-of-war camps, now called reservations. 
The Pine Ridge Reservation, the subject of today's slide show, is located about 75 miles southeast of the Black Hills in South Dakota. 
It is sometimes referred to as Prisoner of War Camp Number 334, and it is where the Lakota now live. 
Now, if any of you have ever heard of AIM, the American Indian Movement, or of Russell Means, or Leonard Peltier, or of the standoff at Oglala, then you know Pine Ridge is ground zero for Native issues in the US. 
So I've been asked to talk a little bit today about my relationship with the Lakota, and that's a very difficult one for me, because, if you haven't noticed from my skin color, I'm white, and that is a huge barrier on a Native reservation. 
You'll see a lot of people in my photographs today. 
I've become very close with them, and they've welcomed me like family. 
They've called me "brother" and "uncle," and invited me again and again over five years. 
But on Pine Ridge, I will always be what is called "wasichu." 
"Wasichu" is a Lakota word that means "non-Indian," but another version of this word means "the one who takes the best meat for himself." 
And that's what I want to focus on -- the one who takes the best part of the meat. 
It means "greedy." 
So take a look around this auditorium today. 
We are at a private school in the American West, sitting in red velvet chairs with money in our pockets. 
And if we look at our lives, we have indeed taken the best part of the meat. 
So let's look today at a set of photographs of a people who lost so that we could gain, and know that when you see these people's faces, that these are not just images of the Lakota; they stand for all indigenous people. 
On this piece of paper is the history the way I learned it from my Lakota friends and family. 
The following is a time line of treaties made, treaties broken and massacres disguised as battles. 
I'll begin in 1824. 
What is known as the Bureau of Indian Affairs was created within the War Department, setting an early tone of aggression in our dealings with the Native Americans. 
1851: The first treaty of Fort Laramie was made, clearly marking the boundaries of the Lakota Nation. 
According to the treaty, those lands are a sovereign nation. 
If the boundaries of this treaty had held -- and there is a legal basis that they should -- then this is what the US would look like today. 
Ten years later. 
The Homestead Act, signed by President Lincoln, unleashed a flood of white settlers into Native lands. 
1863: An uprising of Santee Sioux in Minnesota ends with the hanging of 38 Sioux men, the largest mass execution in US history. 
The execution was ordered by President Lincoln, only two days after he signed the Emancipation Proclamation. 
1866: The beginning of the Transcontinental Railroad -- a new era. 
We appropriated land for trails and trains to shortcut through the heart of the Lakota Nation. 
The treaties were out the window. 
In response, three tribes led by the Lakota chief Red Cloud attacked and defeated the US army, many times over. 
I want to repeat that part: The Lakota defeat the US army. 
1868: The second Fort Laramie Treaty clearly guarantees the sovereignty of the Great Sioux Nation and the Lakotas' ownership of the sacred Black Hills. 
The government also promises land and hunting rights in the surrounding states. 
We promise that the Powder River country will henceforth be closed to all whites. 
The treaty seemed to be a complete victory for Red Cloud and the Sioux. 
In fact, this is the only war in American history in which the government negotiated a peace by conceding everything demanded by the enemy. 
1869: The Transcontinental Railroad was completed. 
It began carrying, among other things, large numbers of hunters, who began the wholesale killing of buffalo, eliminating a source of food, clothing and shelter for the Sioux. 
1871: The Indian Appropriation Act makes all Indians wards of the federal government. 
In addition, the military issued orders forbidding western Indians from leaving reservations. 
All western Indians at that point in time were now prisoners of war. 
Also in 1871, we ended the time of treaty-making. 
The problem with treaties is they allow tribes to exist as sovereign nations, and we can't have that. 
We had plans. 
1874: General George Custer announced the discovery of gold in Lakota territory, specifically the Black Hills. 
The news of gold creates a massive influx of white settlers into Lakota Nation. 
Custer recommends that Congress find a way to end the treaties with the Lakota as soon as possible. 
1875: The Lakota war begins over the violation of the Fort Laramie Treaty. 
1876: On July 26th, on its way to attack a Lakota village, Custer's 7th Cavalry was crushed at the battle of Little Big Horn. 
1877: The great Lakota warrior and chief named Crazy Horse surrendered at Fort Robinson. 
He was later killed while in custody. 
1877 is also the year we found a way to get around the Fort Laramie Treaties. 
A new agreement was presented to Sioux chiefs and their leading men, under a campaign known as "Sell or Starve" -- sign the paper, or no food for your tribe. 
Only 10 percent of the adult male population signed. 
The Fort Laramie Treaty called for at least three-quarters of the tribe to sign away land. 
That clause was obviously ignored. 
1887: The Dawes Act. 
Communal ownership of reservation lands ends. 
Reservations are cut up into 160-acre sections, and distributed to individual Indians with the surplus disposed of. 
Tribes lost millions of acres. 
The American dream of individual land ownership turned out to be a very clever way to divide the reservation until nothing was left. 
The move destroyed the reservations, making it easier to further subdivide and to sell with every passing generation. 
Most of the surplus land and many of the plots within reservation boundaries are now in the hands of white ranchers. 
Once again, the fat of the land goes to wasichu. 
1890: A date I believe to be the most important in this slide show. 
This is the year of the Wounded Knee Massacre. 
On December 29, US troops surrounded a Sioux encampment at Wounded Knee Creek, and massacred Chief Big Foot and 300 prisoners of war, using a new rapid-fire weapon that fired exploding shells, called a Hotchkiss gun. 
For this so-called "battle," 20 Congressional Medals of Honor for Valor were given to the 7th Cavalry. 
To this day, this is the most Medals of Honor ever awarded for a single battle. 
More Medals of Honor were given for the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children than for any battle in World War One, World War Two, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq or Afghanistan. 
The Wounded Knee Massacre is considered the end of the Indian wars. 
Whenever I visit the site of the mass grave at Wounded Knee, I see it not just as a grave for the Lakota or for the Sioux, but as a grave for all indigenous peoples. 
The holy man Black Elk, said, "I did not know then how much was ended. 
When I look back now from this high hill of my old age, I can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch, as plain as when I saw them with eyes still young. 
And I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud and was buried in the blizzard. 
A people's dream died there. 
And it was a beautiful dream." 
With this event, a new era in Native American history began. 
Everything can be measured before Wounded Knee and after, because it was in this moment, with the fingers on the triggers of the Hotchkiss guns, that the US government openly declared its position on Native rights. 
They were tired of treaties. 
They were tired of ghost dances. 
And they were tired of all the inconveniences of the Sioux. 
So they brought out their cannons. 
"You want to be an Indian now?" they said, finger on the trigger. 
1900: the US Indian population reached its low point -- less than 250,000, compared to an estimated eight million in 1492. 
Fast-forward. 
1980: The longest-running court case in US history, the Sioux Nation versus the United States, was ruled upon by the US Supreme Court. 
The court determined that when the Sioux were resettled onto reservations and seven million acres of their land were opened up to prospectors and homesteaders, the terms of the second Fort Laramie Treaty had been violated. 
The court stated that the Black Hills were illegally taken, and that the initial offering price, plus interest, should be paid to the Sioux Nation. 
As payment for the Black Hills, the court awarded only 106 million dollars to the Sioux Nation. 
The Sioux refused the money with the rallying cry, "The Black Hills are not for sale." 
2010: Statistics about Native population today, more than a century after the massacre at Wounded Knee, reveal the legacy of colonization, forced migration and treaty violations. 
Unemployment on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation fluctuates between 85 and 90 percent. 
The housing office is unable to build new structures, and existing structures are falling apart. 
Many are homeless, and those with homes are packed into rotting buildings with up to five families. 
Thirty-nine percent of homes on Pine Ridge have no electricity. 
At least 60 percent of the homes on the reservation are infested with black mold. 
More than 90 percent of the population lives below the federal poverty line. 
The tuberculosis rate on Pine Ridge is approximately eight times higher than the US national average. 
The infant mortality rate is the highest on this continent, and is about three times higher than the US national average. 
Cervical cancer is five times higher than the US national average. 
The school dropout rate is up to 70 percent. 
Teacher turnover is eight times higher than the US national average. 
Frequently, grandparents are raising their grandchildren because parents, due to alcoholism, domestic violence and general apathy, cannot raise them. 
Fifty percent of the population over the age of 40 suffers from diabetes. 
The life expectancy for men is between 46 and 48 years old -- roughly the same as in Afghanistan and Somalia. 
The last chapter in any successful genocide is the one in which the oppressor can remove their hands and say, "My god -- what are these people doing to themselves? 
They're killing each other. 
They're killing themselves while we watch them die." 
This is how we came to own these United States. 
This is the legacy of Manifest Destiny. 
Prisoners are still born into prisoner of war camps, long after the guards are gone. 
These are the bones left after the best meat has been taken. 
A long time ago, a series of events was set in motion by a people who look like me, by wasichu, eager to take the land and the water and the gold in the hills. 
Those events led to a domino effect that has yet to end. 
As removed as we, the dominant society, may feel from a massacre in 1890, or a series of broken treaties 150 years ago, I still have to ask you the question: How should you feel about the statistics of today? 
What is the connection between these images of suffering and the history that I just read to you? 
And how much of this history do you need to own, even? 
Is any of this your responsibility today? 
I have been told that there must be something we can do. 
There must be some call to action. 
Because for so long, I've been standing on the sidelines, content to be a witness, just taking photographs. 
Because the solutions seem so far in the past, I needed nothing short of a time machine to access them. 
The suffering of indigenous peoples is not a simple issue to fix. 
It's not something everyone can get behind the way they get behind helping Haiti, or ending AIDS, or fighting a famine. 
The "fix," as it's called, may be much more difficult for the dominant society than, say, a $50 check or a church trip to paint some graffiti-covered houses, or a suburban family donating a box of clothes they don't even want anymore. 
So where does that leave us? 
Shrugging our shoulders in the dark? 
The United States continues on a daily basis to violate the terms of the 1851 and 1868 Fort Laramie Treaties with the Lakota. 
The call to action I offer today -- my TED wish -- is this: Honor the treaties. 
Give back the Black Hills. 
It's not your business what they do with them. 
(Applause) 

This cell phone started its trajectory in an artisanal mine in the Eastern Congo. 
It's mined by armed gangs using slaves, child slaves, what the U.N. Security Council calls "blood minerals," then traveled into some components and ended up in a factory in Shinjin in China. 
That factory -- over a dozen people have committed suicide already this year. 
One man died after working a 36-hour shift. 
We all love chocolate. 
We buy it for our kids. 
Eighty percent of the cocoa comes from Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana and it's harvested by children. 
Cote d'Ivoire, we have a huge problem of child slaves. 
Children have been trafficked from other conflict zones to come and work on the coffee plantations. 
Heparin -- a blood thinner, a pharmaceutical product -- starts out in artisanal workshops like this in China, because the active ingredient comes from pigs' intestines. 
Your diamond -- you've all heard, probably seen the movie "Blood Diamond." 
This is a mine in Zimbabwe right now. 
Cotton: Uzbekistan is the second biggest exporter of cotton on Earth. 
Every year when it comes to the cotton harvest, the government shuts down the schools, puts the kids in buses, buses them to the cotton fields to spend three weeks harvesting the cotton. 
It's forced child labor on an institutional scale. 
And all of those products probably end their lives in a dump like this one in Manila. 
These places, these origins, represent governance gaps. 
That's the politest description I have for them. 
These are the dark pools where global supply chains begin -- the global supply chains, which bring us our favorite brand name products. 
Some of these governance gaps are run by rogue states. 
Some of them are not states anymore at all. 
They're failed states. 
Some of them are just countries who believe that deregulation or no regulation is the best way to attract investment, promote trade. 
Either way, they present us with a huge moral and ethical dilemma. 
I know that none of us want to be accessories after the fact of a human rights abuse in a global supply chain. 
But right now, most of the companies involved in these supply chains don't have any way of assuring us that nobody had to mortgage their future, nobody had to sacrifice their rights to bring us our favorite brand name product. 
Now, I didn't come here to depress you about the state of the global supply chain. 
We need a reality check. 
We need to recognize just how serious a deficit of rights we have. 
This is an independent republic, probably a failed state. 
It's definitely not a democratic state. 
And right now, that independent republic of the supply chain is not being governed in a way that would satisfy us, that we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption. 
Now, that's not a new story. 
You've seen the documentaries of sweatshops making garments all over the world, even in developed countries. 
You want to see the classic sweatshop, meet me at Madison Square Garden, I'll take you down the street, and I'll show you a Chinese sweatshop. 
But take the example of heparin. 
It's a pharmaceutical product. 
You expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital, probably squeaky clean. 
The problem is that the active ingredient in there -- as I mentioned earlier -- comes from pigs. 
The main American manufacturer of that active ingredient decided a few years ago to relocate to China because it's the world's biggest supplier of pigs. 
And their factory in China -- which probably is pretty clean -- is getting all of the ingredients from backyard abattoirs, where families slaughter pigs and extract the ingredient. 
So a couple of years ago, we had a scandal which killed about 80 people around the world, because of contaminants that crept into the heparin supply chain. 
Worse, some of the suppliers realized that they could substitute a product which mimicked heparin in tests. 
This substitute cost nine dollars a pound, whereas real heparin, the real ingredient, cost 900 dollars a pound. 
A no-brainer. 
The problem was that it killed more people. 
And so you're asking yourself, "How come the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allowed this to happen? 
How did the Chinese State Agency for Food and Drugs allow this to happen?" 
And the answer is quite simple: the Chinese define these facilities as chemical facilities, not pharmaceutical facilities, so they don't audit them. 
And the USFDA has a jurisdictional problem. 
This is offshore. 
They actually do conduct a few investigations overseas -- about a dozen a year -- maybe 20 in a good year. 
There are 500 of these facilities producing active ingredients in China alone. 
In fact, about 80 percent of the active ingredients in medicines now come from offshore, particularly China and India, and we don't have a governance system. 
We don't have a regulatory system able to ensure that that production is safe. 
We don't have a system to ensure that human rights, basic dignity, are ensured. 
So at a national level -- and we work in about 60 different countries -- at a national level we've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments to regulate production on their own soil. 
And the real problem with the global supply chain is that it's supranational. 
So governments who are failing, who are dropping the ball at a national level, have even less ability to get their arms around the problem at an international level. 
And you can just look at the headlines. 
Take Copenhagen last year -- complete failure of governments to do the right thing in the face of an international challenge. 
Take the G20 meeting a couple of weeks ago -- stepped back from its commitments of just a few months ago. 
You can take any one of the major global challenges we've discussed this week and ask yourself, where is the leadership from governments to step up and come up with solutions, responses, to those international problems? 
And the simple answer is they can't. They're national. 
Their voters are local. 
They have parochial interests. 
They can't subordinate those interests to the greater global public good. 
So, if we're going to ensure the delivery of the key public goods at an international level -- in this case, in the global supply chain -- we have to come up with a different mechanism. 
We need a different machine. 
Fortunately, we have some examples. 
In the 1990s, there were a whole series of scandals concerning the production of brand name goods in the U.S. -- child labor, forced labor, serious health and safety abuses. 
And eventually President Clinton, in 1996, convened a meeting at the White House, invited industry, human rights NGOs, trade unions, the Department of Labor, got them all in a room and said, "Look, I don't want globalization to be a race to the bottom. 
I don't know how to prevent that, but I'm at least going to use my good offices to get you folks together to come up with a response." 
So they formed a White House task force, and they spent about three years arguing about who takes how much responsibility in the global supply chain. 
Companies didn't feel it was their responsibility. 
They don't own those facilities. 
They don't employ those workers. 
They're not legally liable. 
Everybody else at the table said, "Folks, that doesn't cut it. 
You have a custodial duty, a duty of care, to make sure that that product gets from wherever to the store in a way that allows us to consume it, without fear of our safety, or without having to sacrifice our conscience to consume that product." 
So they agreed, "Okay, what we'll do is we agree on a common set of standards, code of conduct. 
We'll apply that throughout our global supply chain regardless of ownership or control. 
We'll make it part of the contract." 
And that was a stroke of absolute genius, because what they did was they harnessed the power of the contract, private power, to deliver public goods. 
And let's face it, the contract from a major multinational brand to a supplier in India or China has much more persuasive value than the local labor law, the local environmental regulations, the local human rights standards. 
Those factories will probably never see an inspector. 
If the inspector did come along, it would be amazing if they were able to resist the bribe. 
Even if they did their jobs, and they cited those facilities for their violations, the fine would be derisory. 
But you lose that contract for a major brand name, that's the difference between staying in business or going bankrupt. 
That makes a difference. 
So what we've been able to do is we've been able to harness the power and the influence of the only truly transnational institution in the global supply chain, that of the multinational company, and get them to do the right thing, get them to use that power for good, to deliver the key public goods. 
Now of course, this doesn't come naturally to multinational companies. 
They weren't set up to do this. They're set up to make money. 
But they are extremely efficient organizations. 
They have resources, and if we can add the will, the commitment, they know how to deliver that product. 
Now, getting there is not easy. 
Those supply chains I put up on the screen earlier, they're not there. 
You need a safe space. 
You need a place where people can come together, sit down without fear of judgment, without recrimination, to actually face the problem, agree on the problem and come up with solutions. 
We can do it. The technical solutions are there. 
The problem is the lack of trust, the lack of confidence, the lack of partnership between NGOs, campaign groups, civil society organizations and multinational companies. 
If we can put those two together in a safe space, get them to work together, we can deliver public goods right now, or in extremely short supply. 
This is a radical proposition, and it's crazy to think that if you're a 15-year-old Bangladeshi girl leaving your rural village to go and work in a factory in Dhaka -- 22, 23, 24 dollars a month -- your best chance of enjoying rights at work is if that factory is producing for a brand name company which has got a code of conduct and made that code of conduct part of the contract. 
It's crazy. 
Multinationals are protecting human rights. 
I know there's going to be disbelief. 
You'll say, "How can we trust them?" 
Well, we don't. 
It's the old arms control phrase: "Trust, but verify." 
So we audit. 
We take their supply chain, we take all the factory names, we do a random sample, we send inspectors on an unannounced basis to inspect those facilities, and then we publish the results. 
Transparency is absolutely critical to this. 
You can call yourself responsible, but responsibility without accountability often doesn't work. 
So what we're doing is, we're not only enlisting the multinationals, we're giving them the tools to deliver this public good -- respect for human rights -- and we're checking. 
You don't need to believe me. You shouldn't believe me. 
Go to the website. Look at the audit results. 
Ask yourself, is this company behaving in a socially responsible way? 
Can I buy that product without compromising my ethics? 
That's the way the system works. 
I hate the idea that governments are not protecting human rights around the world. 
I hate the idea that governments have dropped this ball and I can't get used to the idea that somehow we can't get them to do their jobs. 
I've been at this for 30 years, and in that time I've seen the ability, the commitment, the will of government to do this decline, and I don't see them making a comeback right now. 
So we started out thinking this was a stopgap measure. 
We're now thinking that, in fact, this is probably the start of a new way of regulating and addressing international challenges. 
Call it network governance. Call it what you will. 
The private actors, companies and NGOs, are going to have to get together to face the major challenges we are going to face. 
Just look at pandemics -- swine flu, bird flu, H1N1. 
Look at the health systems in so many countries. 
Do they have the resources to face up to a serious pandemic? 
No. 
Could the private sector and NGOs get together and marshal a response? 
Absolutely. 
What they lack is that safe space to come together, agree and move to action. 
That's what we're trying to provide. 
I know as well that this often seems like an overwhelming level of responsibility for people to assume. 
"You want me to deliver human rights throughout my global supply chain. 
There are thousands of suppliers in there." 
It seems too daunting, too dangerous, for any company to take on. 
But there are companies. 
We have 4,000 companies who are members. 
Some of them are very, very large companies. 
The sporting goods industry, in particular, stepped up to the plate and have done it. 
The example, the role model, is there. 
And whenever we discuss one of these problems that we have to address -- child labor in cottonseed farms in India -- this year we will monitor 50,000 cottonseed farms in India. 
It seems overwhelming. 
The numbers just make you want to zone out. 
But we break it down to some basic realities. 
And human rights comes down to a very simple proposition: can I give this person their dignity back? 
Poor people, people whose human rights have been violated -- the crux of that is the loss of dignity, the lack of dignity. 
It starts with just giving people back their dignity. 
I was sitting in a slum outside Gurgaon just next to Delhi, one of the flashiest, brightest new cities popping up in India right now, and I was talking to workers who worked in garment sweatshops down the road, and I asked them what message they would like me to take to the brands. 
They didn't say money. 
They said, "The people who employ us treat us like we are less than human, like we don't exist. 
Please ask them to treat us like human beings." 
That's my simple understanding of human rights. 
That's my simple proposition to you, my simple plea to every decision-maker in this room, everybody out there. 
We can all make a decision to come together and pick up the balls and run with the balls that governments have dropped. 
If we don't do it, we're abandoning hope, we're abandoning our essential humanity, and I know that's not a place we want to be, and we don't have to be there. 
So I appeal to you. 
Join us, come into that safe space, and let's start to make this happen. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

Do you ever feel completely overwhelmed when you're faced with a complex problem? 
Well, I hope to change that in less than three minutes. 
So, I hope to convince you that complex doesn't always equal complicated. 
So for me, a well-crafted baguette, fresh out of the oven, is complex, but a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread is complicated. 
I'm an ecologist, and I study complexity. I love complexity. 
And I study that in the natural world, the interconnectedness of species. 
So here's a food web, or a map of feeding links between species that live in Alpine Lakes in the mountains of California. 
And this is what happens to that food web when it's stocked with non-native fish that never lived there before. 
All the grayed-out species disappear. 
Some are actually on the brink of extinction. 
And lakes with fish have more mosquitos, even though they eat them. 
These effects were all unanticipated, and yet we're discovering they're predictable. 
So I want to share with you a couple key insights about complexity we're learning from studying nature that maybe are applicable to other problems. 
First is the simple power of good visualization tools to help untangle complexity and just encourage you to ask questions you didn't think of before. 
For example, you could plot the flow of carbon through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem, or the interconnections of habitat patches for endangered species in Yosemite National Park. 
The next thing is that if you want to predict the effect of one species on another, if you focus only on that link, and then you black box the rest, it's actually less predictable than if you step back, consider the entire system -- all the species, all the links -- and from that place, hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most. 
And we're discovering, with our research, that's often very local to the node you care about within one or two degrees. 
So the more you step back, embrace complexity, the better chance you have of finding simple answers, and it's often different than the simple answer that you started with. 
So let's switch gears and look at a really complex problem courtesy of the U.S. government. 
This is a diagram of the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan. 
It was front page of the New York Times a couple months ago. 
Instantly ridiculed by the media for being so crazy complicated. 
And the stated goal was to increase popular support for the Afghan government. 
Clearly a complex problem, but is it complicated? 
Well, when I saw this in the front page of the Times, I thought, "Great. Finally something I can relate to. 
I can sink my teeth into this." 
So let's do it. So here we go for the first time ever, a world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network. 
The circled node is the one we're trying to influence -- popular support for the government. 
And so now we can look one degrees, two degrees, three degrees away from that node and eliminate three-quarters of the diagram outside that sphere of influence. 
Within that sphere, most of those nodes are not actionable, like the harshness of the terrain, and a very small minority are actual military actions. 
Most are non-violent and they fall into two broad categories: active engagement with ethnic rivalries and religious beliefs and fair, transparent economic development and provisioning of services. 
I don't know about this, but this is what I can decipher from this diagram in 24 seconds. 
When you see a diagram like this, I don't want you to be afraid. 
I want you to be excited. I want you to be relieved. 
Because simple answers may emerge. 
We're discovering in nature that simplicity often lies on the other side of complexity. 
So for any problem, the more you can zoom out and embrace complexity, the better chance you have of zooming in on the simple details that matter most. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

We've got a real problem with math education right now. 
Basically, no one's very happy. 
Those learning it think it's disconnected, uninteresting and hard. 
Those trying to employ them think they don't know enough. 
Governments realize that it's a big deal for our economies, but don't know how to fix it. 
And teachers are also frustrated. 
Yet math is more important to the world than at any point in human history. 
So at one end we've got falling interest in education in math, and at the other end we've got a more mathematical world, a more quantitative world than we ever have had. 
So what's the problem, why has this chasm opened up, and what can we do to fix it? 
Well actually, I think the answer is staring us right in the face: Use computers. 
I believe that correctly using computers is the silver bullet for making math education work. 
So to explain that, let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world and what it looks like in education. 
See, in the real world math isn't necessarily done by mathematicians. 
It's done by geologists, engineers, biologists, all sorts of different people -- modeling and simulation. 
It's actually very popular. 
But in education it looks very different -- dumbed-down problems, lots of calculating, mostly by hand. 
Lots of things that seem simple and not difficult like in the real world, except if you're learning it. 
And another thing about math: math sometimes looks like math -- like in this example here -- and sometimes it doesn't -- like "Am I drunk?" 
And then you get an answer that's quantitative in the modern world. 
You wouldn't have expected that a few years back. 
But now you can find out all about -- unfortunately, my weight is a little higher than that, but -- all about what happens. 
So let's zoom out a bit and ask, why are we teaching people math? 
What's the point of teaching people math? 
And in particular, why are we teaching them math in general? 
Why is it such an important part of education as a sort of compulsory subject? 
Well, I think there are about three reasons: technical jobs so critical to the development of our economies, what I call "everyday living" -- to function in the world today, you've got to be pretty quantitative, much more so than a few years ago: figure out your mortgages, being skeptical of government statistics, those kinds of things -- and thirdly, what I would call something like logical mind training, logical thinking. 
Over the years we've put so much in society into being able to process and think logically. It's part of human society. 
It's very important to learn that math is a great way to do that. 
So let's ask another question. 
What is math? 
What do we mean when we say we're doing math, or educating people to do math? 
Well, I think it's about four steps, roughly speaking, starting with posing the right question. 
What is it that we want to ask? What is it we're trying to find out here? 
And this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world, beyond virtually any other part of doing math. 
People ask the wrong question, and surprisingly enough, they get the wrong answer, for that reason, if not for others. 
So the next thing is take that problem and turn it from a real world problem into a math problem. 
That's stage two. 
Once you've done that, then there's the computation step. 
Turn it from that into some answer in a mathematical form. 
And of course, math is very powerful at doing that. 
And then finally, turn it back to the real world. 
Did it answer the question? 
And also verify it -- crucial step. 
Now here's the crazy thing right now. 
In math education, we're spending about perhaps 80 percent of the time teaching people to do step three by hand. 
Yet, that's the one step computers can do better than any human after years of practice. 
Instead, we ought to be using computers to do step three and using the students to spend much more effort on learning how to do steps one, two and four -- conceptualizing problems, applying them, getting the teacher to run them through how to do that. 
See, crucial point here: math is not equal to calculating. 
Math is a much broader subject than calculating. 
Now it's understandable that this has all got intertwined over hundreds of years. 
There was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand. 
But in the last few decades that has totally changed. 
We've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject that I could ever imagine with computers. 
Calculating was typically the limiting step, and now often it isn't. 
So I think in terms of the fact that math has been liberated from calculating. 
But that math liberation didn't get into education yet. 
See, I think of calculating, in a sense, as the machinery of math. 
It's the chore. 
It's the thing you'd like to avoid if you can, like to get a machine to do. 
It's a means to an end, not an end in itself, and automation allows us to have that machinery. 
Computers allow us to do that -- and this is not a small problem by any means. 
I estimated that, just today, across the world, we spent about 106 average world lifetimes teaching people how to calculate by hand. 
That's an amazing amount of human endeavor. 
So we better be damn sure -- and by the way, they didn't even have fun doing it, most of them -- so we better be damn sure that we know why we're doing that and it has a real purpose. 
I think we should be assuming computers for doing the calculating and only doing hand calculations where it really makes sense to teach people that. 
And I think there are some cases. 
For example: mental arithmetic. 
I still do a lot of that, mainly for estimating. 
People say, "Is such and such true?" 
And I'll say, "Hmm, not sure." I'll think about it roughly. 
It's still quicker to do that and more practical. 
So I think practicality is one case where it's worth teaching people by hand. 
And then there are certain conceptual things that can also benefit from hand calculating, but I think they're relatively small in number. 
One thing I often ask about is ancient Greek and how this relates. 
See, the thing we're doing right now is we're forcing people to learn mathematics. 
It's a major subject. 
I'm not for one minute suggesting that, if people are interested in hand calculating or in following their own interests in any subject however bizarre -- they should do that. 
That's absolutely the right thing, for people to follow their self-interest. 
I was somewhat interested in ancient Greek, but I don't think that we should force the entire population to learn a subject like ancient Greek. 
I don't think it's warranted. 
So I have this distinction between what we're making people do and the subject that's sort of mainstream and the subject that, in a sense, people might follow with their own interest and perhaps even be spiked into doing that. 
So what are the issues people bring up with this? 
Well one of them is, they say, you need to get the basics first. 
You shouldn't use the machine until you get the basics of the subject. 
So my usual question is, what do you mean by "basics?" 
Basics of what? 
Are the basics of driving a car learning how to service it, or design it for that matter? 
Are the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill? 
I don't think so. 
I think you need to separate the basics of what you're trying to do from how it gets done and the machinery of how it gets done and automation allows you to make that separation. 
A hundred years ago, it's certainly true that to drive a car you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car and how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things. 
But automation in cars allowed that to separate, so driving is now a quite separate subject, so to speak, from engineering of the car or learning how to service it. 
So automation allows this separation and also allows -- in the case of driving, and I believe also in the future case of maths -- a democratized way of doing that. 
It can be spread across a much larger number of people who can really work with that. 
So there's another thing that comes up with basics. 
People confuse, in my view, the order of the invention of the tools with the order in which they should use them for teaching. 
So just because paper was invented before computers, it doesn't necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject by using paper instead of a computer to teach mathematics. 
My daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this. 
She enjoys making what she calls "paper laptops." 
(Laughter) So I asked her one day, "You know, when I was your age, I didn't make these. 
Why do you think that was?" 
And after a second or two, carefully reflecting, she said, "No paper?" 
(Laughter) If you were born after computers and paper, it doesn't really matter which order you're taught with them in, you just want to have the best tool. 
So another one that comes up is "Computers dumb math down." 
That somehow, if you use a computer, it's all mindless button-pushing, but if you do it by hand, it's all intellectual. 
This one kind of annoys me, I must say. 
Do we really believe that the math that most people are doing in school practically today is more than applying procedures to problems they don't really understand, for reasons they don't get? 
I don't think so. 
And what's worse, what they're learning there isn't even practically useful anymore. 
Might have been 50 years ago, but it isn't anymore. 
When they're out of education, they do it on a computer. 
Just to be clear, I think computers can really help with this problem, actually make it more conceptual. 
Now, of course, like any great tool, they can be used completely mindlessly, like turning everything into a multimedia show, like the example I was shown of solving an equation by hand, where the computer was the teacher -- show the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand. 
This is just nuts. 
Why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand that the computer should be doing anyway? 
All backwards. 
Let me show you that you can also make problems harder to calculate. 
See, normally in school, you do things like solve quadratic equations. 
But you see, when you're using a computer, you can just substitute. 
You can make it a quartic equation. Make it kind of harder, calculating-wise. 
Same principles applied -- calculations, harder. 
And problems in the real world look nutty and horrible like this. 
They've got hair all over them. 
They're not just simple, dumbed-down things that we see in school math. 
And think of the outside world. 
Do we really believe that engineering and biology and all of these other things that have so benefited from computers and maths have somehow conceptually gotten reduced by using computers? 
I don't think so -- quite the opposite. 
So the problem we've really got in math education is not that computers might dumb it down, but that we have dumbed-down problems right now. 
Well, another issue people bring up is somehow that hand calculating procedures teach understanding. 
So if you go through lots of examples, you can get the answer, you can understand how the basics of the system work better. 
I think there is one thing that I think very valid here, which is that I think understanding procedures and processes is important. 
But there's a fantastic way to do that in the modern world. 
It's called programming. 
Programming is how most procedures and processes get written down these days, and it's also a great way to engage students much more and to check they really understand. 
If you really want to check you understand math then write a program to do it. 
So programming is the way I think we should be doing that. 
So to be clear, what I really am suggesting here is we have a unique opportunity to make maths both more practical and more conceptual, simultaneously. 
I can't think of any other subject where that's recently been possible. 
It's usually some kind of choice between the vocational and the intellectual. 
But I think we can do both at the same time here. 
And we open up so many more possibilities. 
You can do so many more problems. 
What I really think we gain from this is students getting intuition and experience in far greater quantities than they've ever got before. 
And experience of harder problems -- being able to play with the math, interact with it, feel it. 
We want people who can feel the math instinctively. 
That's what computers allow us to do. 
Another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum. 
Traditionally it's been by how difficult it is to calculate, but now we can reorder it by how difficult it is to understand the concepts, however hard the calculating. 
So calculus has traditionally been taught very late. 
Why is this? 
Well, it's damn hard doing the calculations, that's the problem. 
But actually many of the concepts are amenable to a much younger age group. 
This was an example I built for my daughter. 
And very, very simple. 
We were talking about what happens when you increase the number of sides of a polygon to a very large number. 
And of course, it turns into a circle. 
And by the way, she was also very insistent on being able to change the color, an important feature for this demonstration. 
You can see that this is a very early step into limits and differential calculus and what happens when you take things to an extreme -- and very small sides and a very large number of sides. 
Very simple example. 
That's a view of the world that we don't usually give people for many, many years after this. 
And yet, that's a really important practical view of the world. 
So one of the roadblocks we have in moving this agenda forward is exams. 
In the end, if we test everyone by hand in exams, it's kind of hard to get the curricula changed to a point where they can use computers during the semesters. 
And one of the reasons it's so important -- so it's very important to get computers in exams. 
And then we can ask questions, real questions, questions like, what's the best life insurance policy to get? -- real questions that people have in their everyday lives. 
And you see, this isn't some dumbed-down model here. 
This is an actual model where we can be asked to optimize what happens. 
How many years of protection do I need? 
What does that do to the payments and to the interest rates and so forth? 
Now I'm not for one minute suggesting it's the only kind of question that should be asked in exams, but I think it's a very important type that right now just gets completely ignored and is critical for people's real understanding. 
So I believe [there is] critical reform we have to do in computer-based math. 
We have got to make sure that we can move our economies forward, and also our societies, based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics. 
This isn't some optional extra. 
And the country that does this first will, in my view, leapfrog others in achieving a new economy even, an improved economy, an improved outlook. 
In fact, I even talk about us moving from what we often call now the "knowledge economy" to what we might call a "computational knowledge economy," where high-level math is integral to what everyone does in the way that knowledge currently is. 
We can engage so many more students with this, and they can have a better time doing it. 
And let's understand: this is not an incremental sort of change. 
We're trying to cross the chasm here between school math and the real-world math. 
And you know if you walk across a chasm, you end up making it worse than if you didn't start at all -- bigger disaster. 
No, what I'm suggesting is that we should leap off, we should increase our velocity so it's high, and we should leap off one side and go the other -- of course, having calculated our differential equation very carefully. 
(Laughter) So I want to see a completely renewed, changed math curriculum built from the ground up, based on computers being there, computers that are now ubiquitous almost. 
Calculating machines are everywhere and will be completely everywhere in a small number of years. 
Now I'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math, but what I am sure is it's the mainstream subject of the future. 
Let's go for it, and while we're about it, let's have a bit of fun, for us, for the students and for TED here. 
Thanks. 
(Applause) 

Delighted to be here and to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart, which is beauty. 
I do the philosophy of art, aesthetics, actually, for a living. 
I try to figure out intellectually, philosophically, psychologically, what the experience of beauty is, what sensibly can be said about it and how people go off the rails in trying to understand it. 
Now this is an extremely complicated subject, in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different. 
I mean just think of the sheer variety -- a baby's face, Berlioz's "Harold in Italy," movies like "The Wizard of Oz" or the plays of Chekhov, a central California landscape, a Hokusai view of Mt. Fuji, "Der Rosenkavalier," a stunning match-winning goal in a World Cup soccer match, Van Gogh's "Starry Night," a Jane Austen novel, Fred Astaire dancing across the screen. 
This brief list includes human beings, natural landforms, works of art and skilled human actions. 
An account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy. 
I can, however, give you at least a taste of what I regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have. 
And we get it not from a philosopher of art, not from a postmodern art theorist or a bigwig art critic. 
No, this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding, and you know who I mean: Charles Darwin. 
Of course, a lot of people think they already know the proper answer to the question, "What is beauty?" 
It's in the eye of the beholder. 
It's whatever moves you personally. 
Or, as some people, especially academics prefer, beauty is in the culturally conditioned eye of the beholder. 
People agree that paintings or movies or music are beautiful because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste. 
Taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease. 
Beethoven is adored in Japan. 
Peruvians love Japanese woodblock prints. 
Inca sculptures are regarded as treasures in British museums, while Shakespeare is translated into every major language of the Earth. 
Or just think about American jazz or American movies -- they go everywhere. 
There are many differences among the arts, but there are also universal, cross-cultural aesthetic pleasures and values. 
How can we explain this universality? 
The best answer lies in trying to reconstruct a Darwinian evolutionary history of our artistic and aesthetic tastes. 
We need to reverse-engineer our present artistic tastes and preferences and explain how they came to be engraved in our minds by the actions of both our prehistoric, largely pleistocene environments, where we became fully human, but also by the social situations in which we evolved. 
This reverse engineering can also enlist help from the human record preserved in prehistory. 
I mean fossils, cave paintings and so forth. 
And it should take into account what we know of the aesthetic interests of isolated hunter-gatherer bands that survived into the 19th and the 20th centuries. 
Now, I personally have no doubt whatsoever that the experience of beauty, with its emotional intensity and pleasure, belongs to our evolved human psychology. 
The experience of beauty is one component in a whole series of Darwinian adaptations. 
Beauty is an adaptive effect, which we extend and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment. 
As many of you will know, evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms. 
The first of these is natural selection -- that's random mutation and selective retention -- along with our basic anatomy and physiology -- the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails. 
Natural selection also explains many basic revulsions, such as the horrid smell of rotting meat, or fears, such as the fear of snakes or standing close to the edge of a cliff. 
Natural selection also explains pleasures -- sexual pleasure, our liking for sweet, fat and proteins, which in turn explains a lot of popular foods, from ripe fruits through chocolate malts and barbecued ribs. 
The other great principle of evolution is sexual selection, and it operates very differently. 
The peacock's magnificent tail is the most famous example of this. 
It did not evolve for natural survival. 
In fact, it goes against natural survival. 
No, the peacock's tail results from the mating choices made by peahens. 
It's quite a familiar story. 
It's women who actually push history forward. 
Darwin himself, by the way, had no doubts that the peacock's tail was beautiful in the eyes of the peahen. 
He actually used that word. 
Now, keeping these ideas firmly in mind, we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination, even obsession, in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction. 
Beauty is nature's way of acting at a distance, so to speak. 
I mean, you can't expect to eat an adaptively beneficial landscape. 
It would hardly do to eat your baby or your lover. 
So evolution's trick is to make them beautiful, to have them exert a kind of magnetism to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them. 
Consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure, the magnetic pull of beautiful landscapes. 
People in very different cultures all over the world tend to like a particular kind of landscape, a landscape that just happens to be similar to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved. 
This landscape shows up today on calendars, on postcards, in the design of golf courses and public parks and in gold-framed pictures that hang in living rooms from New York to New Zealand. 
It's a kind of Hudson River school landscape featuring open spaces of low grasses interspersed with copses of trees. 
The trees, by the way, are often preferred if they fork near the ground, that is to say, if they're trees you could scramble up if you were in a tight fix. 
The landscape shows the presence of water directly in view, or evidence of water in a bluish distance, indications of animal or bird life as well as diverse greenery and finally -- get this -- a path or a road, perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline, that extends into the distance, almost inviting you to follow it. 
This landscape type is regarded as beautiful, even by people in countries that don't have it. 
The ideal savanna landscape is one of the clearest examples where human beings everywhere find beauty in similar visual experience. 
But, someone might argue, that's natural beauty. 
How about artistic beauty? 
Isn't that exhaustively cultural? 
No, I don't think it is. 
And once again, I'd like to look back to prehistory to say something about it. 
It is widely assumed that the earliest human artworks are the stupendously skillful cave paintings that we all know from Lascaux and Chauvet. 
Chauvet caves are about 32,000 years old, along with a few small, realistic sculptures of women and animals from the same period. 
But artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that. 
Beautiful shell necklaces that look like something you'd see at an arts and crafts fair, as well as ochre body paint, have been found from around 100,000 years ago. 
But the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts are older even than this. 
I have in mind the so-called Acheulian hand axes. 
The oldest stone tools are choppers from the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa. 
They go back about two-and-a-half-million years. 
These crude tools were around for thousands of centuries, until around 1.4 million years ago when Homo erectus started shaping single, thin stone blades, sometimes rounded ovals, but often in what are to our eyes an arresting, symmetrical pointed leaf or teardrop form. 
These Acheulian hand axes -- they're named after St. Acheul in France, where finds were made in 19th century -- have been unearthed in their thousands, scattered across Asia, Europe and Africa, almost everywhere Homo erectus and Homo ergaster roamed. 
Now, the sheer numbers of these hand axes shows that they can't have been made for butchering animals. 
And the plot really thickens when you realize that, unlike other pleistocene tools, the hand axes often exhibit no evidence of wear on their delicate blade edges. 
And some, in any event, are too big to use for butchery. 
Their symmetry, their attractive materials and, above all, their meticulous workmanship are simply quite beautiful to our eyes, even today. 
So what were these ancient -- I mean, they're ancient, they're foreign, but they're at the same time somehow familiar. 
What were these artifacts for? 
The best available answer is that they were literally the earliest known works of art, practical tools transformed into captivating aesthetic objects, contemplated both for their elegant shape and their virtuoso craftsmanship. 
Hand axes mark an evolutionary advance in human history -- tools fashioned to function as what Darwinians call "fitness signals" -- that is to say, displays that are performances like the peacock's tail, except that, unlike hair and feathers, the hand axes are consciously cleverly crafted. 
Competently made hand axes indicated desirable personal qualities -- intelligence, fine motor control, planning ability, conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials. 
Over tens of thousands of generations, such skills increased the status of those who displayed them and gained a reproductive advantage over the less capable. 
You know, it's an old line, but it has been shown to work -- "Why don't you come up to my cave, so I can show you my hand axes?" 
(Laughter) Except, of course, what's interesting about this is that we can't be sure how that idea was conveyed, because the Homo erectus that made these objects did not have language. 
It's hard to grasp, but it's an incredible fact. 
This object was made by a hominid ancestor, Homo erectus or Homo ergaster, between 50,000 and 100,000 years before language. 
Stretching over a million years, the hand axe tradition is the longest artistic tradition in human and proto-human history. 
By the end of the hand axe epic, Homo sapiens -- as they were then called, finally -- were doubtless finding new ways to amuse and amaze each other by, who knows, telling jokes, storytelling, dancing, or hairstyling. 
Yes, hairstyling -- I insist on that. 
For us moderns, virtuoso technique is used to create imaginary worlds in fiction and in movies, to express intense emotions with music, painting and dance. 
But still, one fundamental trait of the ancestral personality persists in our aesthetic cravings: the beauty we find in skilled performances. 
From Lascaux to the Louvre to Carnegie Hall, human beings have a permanent innate taste for virtuoso displays in the arts. 
We find beauty in something done well. 
So the next time you pass a jewelry shop window displaying a beautifully cut teardrop-shaped stone, don't be so sure it's just your culture telling you that that sparkling jewel is beautiful. 
Your distant ancestors loved that shape and found beauty in the skill needed to make it, even before they could put their love into words. 
Is beauty in the eye of the beholder? 
No, it's deep in our minds. 
It's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills and rich emotional lives of our most ancient ancestors. 
Our powerful reaction to images, to the expression of emotion in art, to the beauty of music, to the night sky, will be with us and our descendants for as long as the human race exists. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Mountain biking in Israel is something that I do with great passion and commitment. 
And when I'm on my bike, I feel that I connect with the profound beauty of Israel, and I feel that I'm united with this country's history and biblical law. 
And also, for me, biking is a matter of empowerment. 
When I reach the summit of a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere, I feel young, invincible, eternal. 
It's as if I'm connecting with some legacy or with some energy far greater than myself. 
You can see my fellow riders at the end of the picture, looking at me with some concern. 
And here is another picture of them. 
Unfortunately, I cannot show their faces, neither can I disclose their true names, and that's because my fellow riders are juvenile inmates, offenders spending time in a correction facility about 20 minutes' ride from here -- well, like everything in Israel. 
And I've been riding with these kids once a week, every Tuesday, rain or shine, for the last four years and by now, they've become a very big part of my life. 
This story began four years ago. 
The correction facility where they are locked up happens to be right in the middle of one of my usual trips, and it's surrounded by barbed wires and electric gates and armed guards. 
So on one of these rides, I talked my way into the compound and went to see the warden. 
I told the warden that I wanted to start a mountain biking club in this place and that basically I wanted to take the kids from here to there. 
And I told him, "Let's find a way in which I'll be able to take out 10 kids once a week to ride with in the summer in the country." 
And the warden was quite amused, and he told me he thought that I was a nut and he told me, "This place is a correction facility. These guys are serious offenders. 
They are supposed to be locked up. 
They aren't supposed to be out at large." 
And yet, we began to talk about it, and one thing led to another. 
And I can't see myself going into a state prison in New Jersey and making such a proposition, but this being Israel, the warden somehow made it happen. 
And so two months later, we found ourselves "at large" -- myself, 10 juvenile inmates and a wonderful fellow named Russ, who became a very good friend of mine and my partner in this project. 
And in the next few weeks, I had the tremendous pleasure of introducing these kids to the world of total freedom, a world consisting of magnificent vistas like these -- everything you see here is obviously in Israel -- as well as close encounters with all sorts of small creatures coming in all sorts of sizes, colors, shapes, forms and so on. 
In spite of all this splendor, the beginning was extremely frustrating. 
Every small obstacle, every slight uphill, would cause these fellows to stop in their tracks and give up. 
So we had a lot of this going on. 
I found out that they had a very hard time dealing with frustration and difficulties -- not because they were physically unfit. 
But that's one reason why they ended up where they were. 
And I became increasingly more and more agitated, because I was there not only to be with them, but also to ride and create a team and I didn't know what to do. 
Now, let me give you an example. 
We're going downhill in some rocky terrain, and the front tire of Alex gets caught in one of these crevasses here. 
So he crashes down, and he gets slightly injured, but this does not prevent him from jumping up and then starting to jump up and down on his bike and curse violently. 
Then he throws his helmet in the air. 
His backpack goes ballistic in some other direction. 
And then he runs to the nearest tree and starts to break branches and throw rocks and curse like I've never heard. 
And I'm just standing there, watching this scene with a complete disbelief, not knowing what to do. 
I'm used to algorithms and data structures and super motivated students, and nothing in my background prepared me to deal with a raging, violent adolescent in the middle of nowhere. 
And you have to realize that these incidents did not happen in convenient locations. 
They happened in places like this, in the Judean Desert, 20 kilometers away from the nearest road. 
And what you don't see in this picture is that somewhere between these riders there, there's a teenager sitting on a rock, saying, "I'm not moving from here. Forget it. 
I've had it." 
Well, that's a problem because one way or another, you have to get this guy moving because it's getting dark soon and dangerous. 
It took me several such incidents to figure out what I was supposed to do. 
At the beginning, it was a disaster. 
I tried harsh words and threats and they took me nowhere. 
That's what they had all their lives. 
And at some point I found out, when a kid like this gets into a fit, the best thing that you can possibly do is stay as close as possible to this kid, which is difficult, because what you really want to do is go away. 
But that's what he had all his life, people walking away from him. 
So what you have to do is stay close and try to reach in and pet his shoulder or give him a piece of chocolate. 
So I would say, "Alex, I know that it's terribly difficult. 
Why don't you rest for a few minutes and then we'll go on." 
"Go away you maniac-psychopath. 
Why would you bring us to this goddamn place?" 
And I would say, "Relax, Alex. 
Here's a piece of chocolate." 
And Alex would go, "Arrrrggg!" 
Because you have to understand that on these rides we are constantly hungry -- and after the rides also. 
And who is this guy, Alex, to begin with? 
He's a 17-year-old. 
When he was eight, someone put him on a boat in Odessa and sent him, shipped him to Israel on his own. 
And he ended up in south Tel Aviv and did not have the good luck to be picked up by a [unclear] and roamed the streets and became a prominent gang member. 
And he spent the last 10 years of his life in two places only, the slums and the state prison, where he spent the last two years before he ended up sitting on this rock there. 
And so this kid was probably abused, abandoned, ignored, betrayed by almost every adult along the way. 
So, for such a kid, when an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him and doesn't walk away from him in any situation, irrespective of how he behaves, it's a tremendous healing experience. 
It's an act of unconditional acceptance, something that he never had. 
I want to say a few words about vision. 
When I started this program four years ago, I had this original plan of creating a team of winning underdogs. 
I had an image of Lance Armstrong in my mind. 
And it took me exactly two months of complete frustration to realize that this vision was misplaced, and that there was another vision supremely more important and more readily available. 
It all of a sudden dawned on me, in this project, that the purpose of these rides should actually be to expose the kids to one thing only: love. 
Love to the country, to the uphill and the downhill, to all the incredible creatures that surround us -- the animals, the plants, the insects -- love and respect to other fellow members in your team, in your biking team, and most importantly, love and respect to yourself, which is something that they badly miss. 
Together with the kids, I also went through a remarkable transformation. 
Now, I come from a cutthroat world of science and high technology. 
I used to think that reason and logic and relentless drive were the only ways to make things happen. 
And before I worked with the kids, anything that I did with them, or anything that I did with myself, was supposed to be perfect, ideal, optimal, but after working with them for some time, I discovered the great virtues of empathy and flexibility and being able to start with some vision, and if the vision doesn't work, well nothing happened. 
All you have to do is play with it, change it a little bit, and come up with something that does help, that does work. 
So right now, I feel more like these are my principles, and if you don't like them, I have others. 
(Laughter) (Applause) And one of these principles is focus. 
Before each ride we sit together with the kids, and we give them one word to think about during the ride. 
You have to focus their attention on something because so many things happen. 
So these are words like "teamwork" or "endurance" or even complicated concepts like "resource allocation" or "perspective," a word that they don't understand. 
You know, perspective is one of these critically important life-coping strategies that mountain biking can really teach you. 
I tell kids when they struggle through some uphill and feel like they cannot take it anymore, it really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles and raise your head and look around and see how the vista around you grows. 
It literally propels you upwards. 
That's what perspective is all about. 
Or you can also look back in time and realize that you've already conquered steeper mountains before. 
And that's how they develop self-esteem. 
Now, let me give you an example of how it works. 
You stand with your bike at the beginning of February. 
It's very cold, and you're standing in one of these rainy days, and it's drizzling and cold and chilly, and you're standing in, let's say, Yokneam. 
And you look up at the sky through a hole in the clouds you see the monastery at the top of the Muhraka -- that's where you're supposed to climb now -- and you say, "There's no way that I could possibly get there." 
And yet, two hours later you find yourself standing on the roof of this monastery, smeared with mud, blood and sweat. 
And you look down at Yokneam; everything is so small and tiny. 
And you say, "Hey, Alex. Look at this parking lot where we started. 
It's that big. 
I can't believe that I did it." 
And that's the point when you start loving yourself. 
And so we talked about these special words that we teach them. 
And at the end of each ride, we sit together and share moments in which those special words of the day popped up and made a difference, and these discussions can be extremely inspiring. 
In one of them, one of the kids once said, "When we were riding on this ridge overlooking the Dead Sea -- and he's talking about this spot here -- "I was reminded of the day when I left my village in Ethiopia and went away together with my brother. 
We walked 120 kilometers until we reached Sudan. 
This was the first place where we got some water and supplies." 
And he goes on saying, and everyone looks at him like a hero, probably for the first time in his life. 
And he says -- because I also have volunteers riding with me, adults, who are sitting there listening to him -- and he says, "And this was just the beginning of our ordeal until we ended up in Israel. 
And only now," he says, "I'm beginning to understand where I am, and I actually like it." 
Now I remember, when he said it, I felt goosebumps on my body, because he said it overlooking the Moab Mountains here in the background. 
That's where Joshua descended and crossed the Jordan and led the people of Israel into the land of Canaan 3,000 years ago in this final leg of the journey from Africa. 
And so, perspective and context and history play key roles in the way I plan my rides with the kids. 
We visit Kibbutzim that were established by Holocaust survivors. 
We explore ruins of Palestinian villages, and we discuss how they became ruins. 
And we go through numerous remnants of Jewish settlements, Nabatic settlements, Canaanite settlements -- three-, four, five-thousand years old. 
And through this tapestry, which is the history of this country, the kids acquire what is probably the most important value in education, and that is the understanding that life is complex, and there's no black and white. 
And by appreciating complexity, they become more tolerant, and tolerance leads to hope. 
I ride with these kids once a week, every Tuesday. 
Here's a picture I took last Tuesday -- less than a week ago -- and I ride with them tomorrow also. 
In every one of these rides I always end up standing in one of these incredible locations, taking in this incredible landscape around me, and I feel blessed and fortunate that I'm alive, and that I sense every fiber in my aching body. 
And I feel blessed and fortunate that 15 years ago I had the courage to resign my tenured position at NYU and return to my home country where I can do these incredible rides with this group of troubled kids coming from Ethiopia and Morocco and Russia. 
And I feel blessed and fortunate that every week, every Tuesday -- and actually every Friday also -- I can once again celebrate in the marrow of my bones the very essence of living in Israel on the edge. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Thank you very much. 
Now, I've got a story for you. 
When I arrived off the plane, after a very long journey from the West of England, my computer, my beloved laptop, had gone mad, and had -- oh! -- a bit like that! -- and the display on it -- anyway, the whole thing had burst. 
And I went to the IT guys here and a gentleman mended my computer, and then he said, "What are you doing here?" 
and I said "I'm playing the cello and I'm doing a bit of singing," and he said, "Oh, I sort of play the cello as well." 
And I said, "Do you really?" 
Anyway, so you're in for a treat, because he's fantastic, and his name's Mark. 
(Applause) I am also joined by my partner in crime, Thomas Dolby. 
(Applause) This song is called "Farther than the Sun." 
(Music) ♫ Strung in the wind I called you ♫ ♫ but you did not hear ... ♫ ♫ And you're a plant that needs poor soil ♫ ♫ and I have treated you too well ♫ ♫ to give up flowers ... ♫ ♫ Oh, I have been too rich for you ... ♫ ♫ Farther than the sun from me ♫ ♫ Farther than I'd have you be ♫ ♫ And I go north, I get so cold ♫ ♫ My heart is lava under stone ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ... ♫ ♫ With your calculating eyes ♫ ♫ spinning figures ♫ ♫ you cannot see me ♫ ♫ You cannot see me ... ♫ ♫ And if I tell myself enough ♫ ♫ I'll believe it ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ♫ ♫ The sea, it freezes over ... ♫ ♫ to trap the light ♫ ♫ And I'm in love with being in love ♫ ♫ and you were never quite the one ♫ ♫ In Gerda's eyes ♫ ♫ Fragments of what you've become ♫ ♫ And all the moths that fly at night ♫ ♫ believe electric light is bright ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ♫ ♫ With your calculating eyes ♫ ♫ Spinning figures ♫ ♫ You cannot see me, no ♫ ♫ And if I tell myself enough ♫ ♫ I'll believe it ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ♫ ♫ Farther than the sun from me ♫ ♫ Farther than I'd have you be ♫ ♫ And I go north, I get so cold ♫ ♫ My heart is lava under stone ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ♫ ♫ With your calculating eyes ♫ ♫ Spinning figures ♫ ♫ You cannot see me, no ... ♫ ♫ And if I tell myself enough, I'll believe it ♫ (Applause) Thank you very much. 

I grew up in a very small village in Canada, and I'm an undiagnosed dyslexic. 
I had a really hard time in school. 
In fact, my mother told me eventually that I was the little kid in the village who cried all the way to school. 
I ran away. 
I left when I was 25 years old to go to Bali, and there I met my incredible wife, Cynthia, and together, over 20 years, we built an amazing jewelry business. 
It was a fairy tale, and then we retired. 
Then she took me to see a film that I really didn't want to see. 
It ruined my life -- (Laughter) "The Inconvenient Truth" and Mr. Gore. 
I have four kids, and even if part of what he says is true, they're not going to have the life that I had. 
And I decided at that moment that I would spend the rest of my life doing whatever I could to improve their possibilities. 
So here's the world, and here we are in Bali. 
It's a tiny, little island -- 60 miles by 90 miles. 
It has an intact Hindu culture. 
Cynthia and I were there. 
We had had a wonderful life there, and we decided to do something unusual. 
We decided to give back locally. 
And here it is: it's called the Green School. 
I know it doesn't look like a school, but it is something we decided to do, and it is extremely, extremely green. 
The classrooms have no walls. 
The teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard. 
The desks are not square. 
At Green School, the children are smiling -- an unusual thing for school, especially for me. 
And we practice holism. 
And for me it's just the idea that, if this little girl graduates as a whole person, chances are she'll demand a whole world -- a whole world -- to live on. 
Our children spend 181 days going to school in a box. 
The people that built my school also built the prison and the insane asylum out of the same materials. 
So if this gentleman had had a holistic education, would he be sitting there? 
Would he have had more possibilities in his life? 
The classrooms have natural light. 
They're beautiful. They're bamboo. 
The breeze passes through them. 
And when the natural breeze isn't enough, the kids deploy bubbles, but not the kind of bubbles you know. 
These bubbles are made from natural cotton and rubber from the rubber tree. 
So we basically turned the box into a bubble. 
And these kids know that painless climate control may not be part of their future. 
We pay the bill at the end of the month, but the people that are really going to pay the bill are our grandchildren. 
We have to teach the kids that the world is not indestructible. 
These kids did a little graffiti on their desks, and then they signed up for two extra courses. 
The first one was called sanding and the second one was called re-waxing. 
But since that happened, they own those desks. 
They know they can control their world. 
We're on the grid. We're not proud of it. 
But an amazing alternative energy company in Paris is taking us off the grid with solar. 
And this thing is the second vortex to be built in the world, in a two-and-a-half meter drop on a river. 
When the turbine drops in, it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity, day and night. 
And you know what these are. 
There's nowhere to flush. 
And as long as we're taking our waste and mixing it with a huge amount of water -- you're all really smart, just do the math. 
How many people times how much water. 
There isn't enough water. 
These are compost toilets, and nobody at the school wanted to know about them, especially the principal. 
And they work. People use them. People are okay. 
It's something you should think about doing. 
Not many things didn't work. 
The beautiful canvas and rubber skylights got eaten by the sun in six months. 
We had to replace them with recyclable plastic. 
The teachers dragged giant PVC whiteboards into the classrooms. 
So we had some good ideas: we took old automobile windshields, put paper behind them and created the first alternative to the whiteboard. 
Green School sits in south-central Bali, and it's on 20 acres of rolling garden. 
There's an amazing river traveling through it, and you can see there how we manage to get across the river. 
I met a father the other day; he looked a little crazed. 
I said, "Welcome to Green School." 
He said, "I've been on an airplane for 24 hours." 
I asked him, "Why?" 
He said, "I had a dream once about a green school, and I saw a picture of this green school, I got on an airplane. 
In August I'm bringing my sons." 
This was a great thing. 
But more than that, people are building green houses around Green School, so their kids can walk to school on the paths. 
And people are bringing their green industries, hopefully their green restaurants, to the Green School. 
It's becoming a community. 
It's becoming a green model. 
We had to look at everything. 
No petrochemicals in the pavement. 
No pavement. 
These are volcanic stones laid by hand. 
There are no sidewalks. 
The sidewalks are gravel. They flood when it rains, but they're green. 
This is the school buffalo. 
He's planning to eat that fence for dinner. 
All the fences at Green School are green. 
And when the kindergarten kids recently moved their gate, they found out the fence was made out of tapioca. 
They took the tapioca roots up to the kitchen, sliced them thinly and made delicious chips. 
Landscaping. 
We manage to keep the garden that was there running right up to the edge of each of the classrooms. 
We dropped them gently in. 
We made space for these guys who are Bali's last black pigs. 
And the school cow is trying to figure out how to replace the lawnmower on the playing field. 
These young ladies are living in a rice culture, but they know something that few people know in a rice culture. 
They know how to plant organic rice, they know how to look after it, they know how to harvest and they know how to cook it. 
They're part of the rice cycle and these skills will be valuable for them in their future. 
This young man is picking organic vegetables. 
We feed 400 people lunch every day and it's not a normal lunch. There's no gas. 
Local Balinese women cook the food on sawdust burners using secrets that only their grandmothers know. 
The food is incredible. 
Green School is a place of pioneers, local and global. 
And it's a kind of microcosm of the globalized world. 
The kids are from 25 countries. 
When I see them together, I know that they're working out how to live in the future. 
Green School is going into its third year with 160 children. 
It's a school where you do learn reading -- one of my favorites -- writing -- I was bad at it -- arithmetic. 
But you also learn other things. 
You learn bamboo building. 
You practice ancient Balinese arts. 
This is called mud wrestling in the rice fields. 
The kids love it. 
The mothers aren't quite convinced. 
(Laughter) We've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives, and we said, okay, local, what does "local" mean? 
Local means that 20 percent of the population of the school has to be Balinese, and this was a really big commitment. 
And we were right. 
And people are coming forward from all over the world to support the Balinese Scholarship Fund, because these kids will be Bali's next green leaders. 
The teachers are as diverse as the student body, and the amazing thing is that volunteers are popping up. 
A man came from Java with a new kind of organic agriculture. 
A woman came from Africa with music. 
And together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global, green leaders. 
The Green School effect -- we don't know what it is. 
We need someone to come and study it. 
But what's happening, our learning-different kids -- dyslexic -- we've renamed them prolexic -- are doing well in these beautiful, beautiful classrooms. 
And all the kids are thriving. 
And how did we do all this? 
On giant grass. 
It's bamboo. 
It comes out of the ground like a train. 
It grows as high as a coconut tree in two months and three years later it can be harvested to build buildings like this. 
It's as strong and dense as teak and it will hold up any roof. 
When the architects came, they brought us these things, and you've probably seen things like this. 
The yellow box was called the administration complex. 
(Laughter) We squashed it, we rethought it, but mainly we renamed it "the heart of school," and that changed everything forever. 
It's a double helix. 
It has administrators in it and many, many other things. 
And the problem of building it -- when the Balinese workers saw long reams of plans, they looked at them and said, "What's this?" 
So we built big models. 
We had them engineered by the engineers. 
And Balinese carpenters like this measured them with their bamboo rulers, selected the bamboo and built the buildings using age-old techniques, mostly by hand. 
It was chaos. 
And the Balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do, so they use metal scaffolding to build the bamboo building and when the scaffolding came down, we realized that we had a cathedral, a cathedral to green, and a cathedral to green education. 
The heart of school has seven kilometers of bamboo in it. 
From the time the foundations were finished, in three months it had roofs and floors. 
It may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world, but many people believe that it's the most beautiful. 
Is this doable in your community? 
We believe it is. 
Green School is a model we built for the world. 
It's a model we built for Bali. 
And you just have to follow these simple, simple rules: be local, let the environment lead and think about how your grandchildren might build. 
So, Mr. Gore, thank you. 
You ruined my life, but you gave me an incredible future. 
And if you're interested in being involved in finishing Green School and building the next 50 around the world, please come and see us. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Today I'm going to take you on a voyage to some place so deep, so dark, so unexplored that we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon. 
It's a place of myth and legend. 
It's a place marked on ancient maps as "here be monsters." 
It is a place where each new voyage of exploration brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed. 
Instead, they just make me green with envy that my colleague from IUCN was able to go on this journey to the south of Madagascar seamounts to actually take photographs and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep. 
We are talking about the high seas. 
The "high seas" is a legal term, but in fact, it covers 50 percent of the planet. 
With an average depth of the oceans of 4,000 meters, in fact, the high seas covers and provides nearly 90 percent of the habitat for life on this Earth. 
It is, in theory, the global commons, belonging to us all. 
But in reality, it is managed by and for those who have the resources to go out and exploit it. 
So today I'm going to take you on a voyage to cast light on some of the outdated myths and legends and assumptions that have kept us as the true stakeholders in the high seas in the dark. 
We're going to voyage to some of these special places that we've been discovering in the past few years to show why we really need to care. 
And then finally, we're going to try to develop and pioneer a new perspective on high seas governance that's rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation, but framed in an arena of global norms of precaution and respect. 
So here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above -- that area in the darker blue. 
To me, as an international lawyer, this scared me far more than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen, for it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean, the global ocean, that provides us all with carbon storage, with heat storage, with oxygen, if you can only protect 36 percent. 
This is indeed the true heart of the planet. 
Some of the problems that we have to confront are that the current international laws -- for example, shipping -- provide more protection to the areas closest to shore. 
For example, garbage discharge, something you would think just simply goes away, but the laws regulating ship discharge of garbage actually get weaker the further you are from shore. 
As a result, we have garbage patches the size of twice-Texas. 
It's unbelievable. 
We used to think the solution to pollution was dilution, but that has proved to be no longer the case. 
So what we have learned from social scientists and economists like Elinor Ostrom, who are studying the phenomenon of management of the commons on a local scale, is that there are certain prerequisites that you can put into place that enable you to manage and access open space for the good of one and all. 
And these include a sense of shared responsibility, common norms that bind people together as a community. 
Conditional access: You can invite people in, but they have to be able to play by the rules. 
And of course, if you want people to play by the rules, you still need an effective system of monitoring and enforcement, for as we've discovered, you can trust, but you also need to verify. 
What I'd also like to convey is that it is not all doom and gloom that we are seeing in the high seas. 
For a group of very dedicated individuals -- scientists, conservationists, photographers and states -- were able to actually change a tragic trajectory that was destroying fragile seascapes such as this coral garden that you see in front of you. 
That is, we're able to save it from a fate of deep-sea bottom trawling. 
And how did we do that? 
Well, as I said, we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships and actually photographed the activities in process. 
But we also spent many hours in the basements of the United Nations, trying to work with governments to make them understand what was going on so far away from land that few of us had ever even imagined that these creatures existed. 
So within three years, from 2003 to 2006, we were able to get norm in place that actually changed the paradigm of how fishers went about deep-sea bottom trawling. 
Instead of "go anywhere, do anything you want," we actually created a regime that required prior assessment of where you're going and a duty to prevent significant harm. 
In 2009, when the U.N. reviewed progress, they discovered that almost 100 million square-kilometers of seabed had been protected. 
This does not mean that it's the final solution, or that this even provides permanent protection. 
But what it does mean is that a group of individuals can form a community to actually shape the way high seas are governed, to create a new regime. 
So I'm looking optimistically at our opportunities for creating a true, blue perspective for this beautiful planet. 
Sylvia's wish provides us with that leverage, that access to the heart of human beings, you might say, who have rarely seen places beyond their own toes, but are now hopefully going to become interested in the full life-cycle of creatures like these sea turtles, who indeed spend most of their time in the high seas. 
Today, we're just going to voyage to a small sampling of some of these special areas, just to give you an idea of the flavor of the riches and wonders they do contain. 
The Sargasso Sea, for example, is not a sea bounded by coastlines, but it is bounded by oceanic currents that contain and envelope this wealth of sargassum that grows and aggregates there. 
It's also known as the spawning ground for eels from Northern European and Northern American rivers that are now so dwindling in numbers that they've actually stopped showing up in Stockholm, and five showed up in the U.K. just recently. 
But the Sargasso Sea, the same way it aggregates sargassum weed, actually is pulling in the plastic from throughout the region. 
This picture doesn't exactly show the plastics that I would like it to show, because I haven't been out there myself. 
But there has just been a study that was released in February that showed there are 200,000 pieces of plastic per square-kilometer now floating in the surface of the Sargasso Sea, and that is affecting the habitat for the many species in their juvenile stages who come to the Sargasso Sea for its protection and its food. 
The Sargasso Sea is also a wondrous place for the aggregation of these unique species that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat. 
It also provides a special habitat for these flying fish to lay their eggs. 
But what I'd like to get from this picture is that we truly do have an opportunity to launch a global initiative for protection. 
Thus, the government of Bermuda has recognized the need and its responsibility as having some of the Sargasso Sea within its national jurisdiction -- but the vast majority is beyond -- to help spearhead a movement to achieve protection for this vital area. 
Spinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now: the Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean. 
It's actually a bay. 
It's considered high seas, because the continent has been put off limits to territorial claims. 
So anything in the water is treated as if it's the high seas. 
But what makes the Ross Sea important is the vast sea of pack ice that in the spring and summer provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill that supports what, till recently, has been a virtually intact near-shore ecosystem. 
But unfortunately, CCAMLR, the regional commission in charge of conserving and managing fish stocks and other living marine resources, is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests and has authorized the expansion of toothfish fisheries in the region. 
The captain of a New Zealand vessel who was just down there is reporting a significant decline in the number of the Ross Sea killer whales, who are directly dependent on the Antarctic toothfish as their main source of food. 
So what we need to do is to stand up boldly, singly and together, to push governments, to push regional fisheries management organizations, to declare our right to declare certain areas off-limits to high seas fishing, so that the freedom to fish no longer means the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime. 
Coming closer to here, the Costa Rica Dome is a recently discovered area -- potentially year-round habitat for blue whales. 
There's enough food there to last them the summer and the winter long. 
But what's unusual about the Costa Rica Dome is, in fact, it's not a permanent place. 
It's an oceanographic phenomenon that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis. 
So, in fact, it's not permanently in the high seas. 
It's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones of these five Central American countries, but it moves with the season. 
As such, it does create a challenge to protect, but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it. 
We can use the same technologies that fishers use to identify where the species are, in order to close the area when it's most vulnerable, which may, in some cases, be year-round. 
Getting closer to shore, where we are, this was in fact taken in the Galapagos. 
Many species are headed through this region, which is why there's been so much attention put into conservation of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape. 
This is the initiative that's been coordinated by Conservation International with a variety of partners and governments to actually try to bring integrated management regime throughout the area. 
That is, it provides a wonderful example of where you can go with a real regional initiative. 
It's protecting five World Heritage sites. 
Unfortunately, the World Heritage Convention does not recognize the need to protect areas beyond national jurisdiction, at present. 
So a place like the Costa Rica Dome could not technically qualify the time it's in the high seas. 
So what we've been suggesting is that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention, so that it can adopt and urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites, or we need to change the name and call it Half-the-World Heritage Convention. 
But what we also know is that species like these sea turtles do not stay put in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape. 
These happen to go down to a vast South Pacific Gyre, where they spend most of their time and often end up getting hooked like this, or as bycatch. 
So what I'd really like to suggest is that we need to scale-up. 
We need to work locally, but we also need to work ocean-basin-wide. 
We have the tools and technologies now to enable us to take a broader ocean-basin-wide initiative. 
We've heard about the Tagging of Pacific Predators project, one of the 17 Census of Marine Life projects. 
It's provided us data like this, of tiny, little sooty shearwaters that make the entire ocean basin their home. 
They fly 65,000 kilometers in less than a year. 
So we have the tools and treasures coming from the Census of Marine Life. 
And its culminating year that's going to be launched in October. 
So stay tuned for further information. 
What I find so exciting is that the Census of Marine Life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators; it's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column, where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found. 
And fortunately, we've been able, as IUCN, to team up with the Census of Marine Life and many of the scientists working there to actually try to translate much of this information to policymakers. 
We have the support of governments now behind us. 
We've been revealing this information through technical workshops. 
And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope spots, hotspots. 
At the same time we're saying, "Yes, we need more. We need to move forward." 
But many of you have said, if you get these marine protected areas, or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place, how are you going to enforce it? 
Which leads me to my second passion besides ocean science, which is outer space technology. 
I wanted to be an astronaut, so I've constantly followed what are the tools available to monitor Earth from outer space -- and that we have incredible tools like we've been learning about, in terms of being able to follow tagged species throughout their life-cycles in the open ocean. 
We can also tag and track fishing vessels. 
Many already have transponders on board that allow us to find out where they are and even what they're doing. 
But not all the vessels have those to date. 
It does not take too much rocket science to actually try to create new laws to mandate, if you're going to have the privilege of accessing our high seas resources, we need to know -- someone needs to know -- where you are and what you're doing. 
So it brings me to my main take-home message, which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons. 
We can stop the collision course of 50 percent of the planet with the high seas. 
But we need to think broad-scale. We need to think globally. 
We need to change how we actually go about managing these resources. 
We need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect. 
At the same time, we need to think locally, which is the joy and marvel of Sylvia's hope spot wish, is that we can shine a spotlight on many of these previously unknown areas, and to bring people to the table, if you will, to actually make them feel part of this community that truly has a stake in their future management. 
And third is that we need to look at ocean-basin-wide management. 
Our species are ocean-basin-wide. 
Many of the deep-sea communities have genetic distribution that goes ocean-basin-wide. 
We need to better understand, but we also need to start to manage and protect. 
And in order to do that, you also need ocean-basin management regimes. 
That is, we have regional management regimes within the exclusive economic zone, but we need to scale these up, we need to build their capacity, so they're like the Southern Ocean, where they do have the two-pronged fisheries and conservation organization. 
So with that, I would just like to sincerely thank and honor Sylvia Earle for her wish, for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction. 
It's helping to bring an incredible group of talented people together to really try to solve and penetrate these problems that have created our obstacles to management and rational use of this area that was once so far away and remote. 
So on this tour, I hope I provided you with a new perspective of the high seas: one, that it is our home too, and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So, a funny thing happened on my way to becoming a brilliant, world-class neuropsychologist: I had a baby. 
And that's not to say I ever went on to become a brilliant, world-class neuropsychologist. 
Sorry, TED. 
But I did go on to be a reasonably astute, arguably world-class worrier. 
One of my girlfriends in graduate school, Marie, said, "Kim, I figured it out. 
It's not that you're more neurotic than everyone else; it's just that you're more honest about how neurotic you are." 
So in the spirit of full disclosure, I brought some pictures to share. 
Awwww. 
(Laughter) I'll just say: July. 
(Laughter) Zip! 
(Laughter) For safety. 
(Laughter) Water wings -- an inch of water. 
And then, finally, all suited up for the 90-minute drive to Copper Mountain. 
So you can get kind of a feel for this. 
So my baby, Vander, is eight years old now. 
And, despite being cursed with my athletic inability, he plays soccer. 
He's interested in playing football. 
He wants to learn how to ride a unicycle. 
So why would I worry? 
Because this is what I do. This is what I teach. 
It's what I study. It's what I treat. 
And I know that kids get concussed every year. 
In fact, more than four million people sustain a concussion every year, and these data are just among kids under 14 who were seen in emergency rooms. 
And so when kids sustain a concussion, we talk about them getting dinged or getting their bell rung, but what is it that we're really talking about? 
Let's take a look. 
[Concussive Force] "Starsky and Hutch"? Arguably, yes. 
So, a car accident. 
Forty miles an hour into a fixed barrier: 35 Gs. 
A heavyweight boxer punches you straight in the face: 58 Gs. 
(Music) In case you missed it, we'll look again. 
So look to the right-hand side of the screen. 
(Music) What would you say? 
How many Gs? 
Close. 
Would it be crazy to know: 103 Gs? 
The average concussive impact is 95 Gs. 
Now, when the kid on the right doesn't get up, we know they've had a concussion. 
But how about the kid on the left, or the athlete that leaves the field of play? 
How do we know if he or she has sustained a concussion? 
How do we know that legislation that would require they be pulled from play, cleared for return to play, applies to them? 
The definition of concussion doesn't actually require a loss of consciousness. 
It requires only a change in consciousness, and that can be any one or a number of symptoms, including feeling foggy, feeling dizzy, hearing a ringing in your ear, being more impulsive or hostile than usual. 
So given all of that and given how darn neurotic I am, how do I get any sleep at all? 
Because I know our brains are resilient. 
They're designed to recover from an injury. 
If -- God forbid -- any of us left here tonight and sustained a concussion, most of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours to a couple of weeks. 
But kids are more vulnerable to brain injury. 
In fact, high-school athletes are three times more likely to sustain catastrophic injuries relative even to their college-age peers, and it takes them longer to return to a symptom-free baseline. 
After that first injury, their risk for second injury is exponentially greater. 
From there, their risk for a third injury, greater still, and so on. 
And here's the really alarming part: We don't fully understand the long-term impact of multiple injuries. 
You guys may be familiar with this research that's coming out of the NFL. 
In a nutshell, this research suggests that, among retired NFL players with three or more career concussions, the incidence of early-onset dementing disease is much greater than it is for the general population. 
So you've all seen that -- New York Times, you've seen it. 
What you may not be familiar with is that this research was spearheaded by NFL wives who said, "Isn't it weird that my 46-year-old husband is forever losing his keys?" 
"Isn't it weird that my 47-year-old husband is forever losing the car?" 
"Isn't it weird that my 48-year-old husband is forever losing his way home in the car, from the driveway?" 
I may have forgotten to mention that my son is an only child. 
So it's going to be really important that he be able to drive me around someday. 
(Laughter) So, how do we guarantee the safety of our kids? 
How can we 100 percent guarantee the safety of our kids? 
Let me tell you what I've come up with. 
(Laughter) If only. 
My little boy's right there, and he's like, "She's not kidding. 
She's totally not kidding." 
So in all seriousness: Should my kid play football? 
Should your kid play football? 
I don't know. 
The first: study up. 
You have to be familiar with the issues we're talking about today. 
There are some great resources out there. 
The CDC has a program, HEADS UP. 
It's at CDC.gov. 
HEADS UP is specific to concussion in kids. 
The second is a resource I'm personally really proud of. 
We've just rolled this out in the last couple months -- CO Kids With Brain Injury. 
This is a great resource for student athletes, teachers, parents, professionals, athletic and coaching staff. 
It's a great place to start if you have questions. 
The second thing is: speak up. 
Just two weeks ago, a bill introduced by Senator Kefalas that would have required athletes, kids under 18, to wear a helmet when they're riding their bike, died in committee. 
It died, in large part, because it lacked constituent buy-in; it lacked stakeholder traction. 
Now, I'm not here to tell you what kind of legislation you should or shouldn't support, but I am going to tell you that, if it matters to you, your legislators need to know that. 
Speak up also with coaching staff. 
Ask about what kind of protective equipment is available. 
What's the budget for protective equipment? 
How old it is? 
Maybe offer to spearhead a fundraiser to buy new gear. 
Which brings us to: suit up. 
Wear a helmet. 
The only way to prevent a bad outcome is to prevent that first injury from happening. 
Recently, one of my graduate students, Tom, said, "Kim, I've decided to wear a bike helmet on the way to class." 
And Tom knows that that little bit of foam in a bike helmet can reduce the g-force of impact by half. 
Now, I thought it was because I have this totally compelling helmet crusade, this epiphany of Tom's. 
As it turns out, it occurred to Tom that a $20 helmet is a good way to protect a $100,000 graduate education. 
(Laughter) So ... 
Should Vander play football? 
I can't say no, but I can guarantee that every time he leaves the house, that kid's wearing a helmet -- like, to the car, or at school. 
So whether athlete, scholar, overprotected kid, neurotic mom, or otherwise, here's my baby, Vander, reminding you to mind your matter. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I woke up in the middle of the night with the sound of heavy explosion. 
It was deep at night. 
I do not remember what time it was. 
I just remember the sound was so heavy and so very shocking. 
Everything in my room was shaking -- my heart, my windows, my bed, everything. 
I looked out the windows and I saw a full half-circle of explosion. 
I thought it was just like the movies, but the movies had not conveyed them in the powerful image that I was seeing full of bright red and orange and gray, and a full circle of explosion. 
And I kept on staring at it until it disappeared. 
I went back to my bed, and I prayed, and I secretly thanked God that that missile did not land on my family's home, that it did not kill my family that night. 
Thirty years have passed, and I still feel guilty about that prayer, for the next day, I learned that that missile landed on my brother's friend's home and killed him and his father, but did not kill his mother or his sister. 
His mother showed up the next week at my brother's classroom and begged seven-year-old kids to share with her any picture they may have of her son, for she had lost everything. 
This is not a story of a nameless survivor of war, and nameless refugees, whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our TV with tattered clothes, dirty face, scared eyes. 
This is not a story of a nameless someone who lived in some war, who we do not know their hopes, their dreams, their accomplishments, their families, their beliefs, their values. 
This is my story. 
I was that girl. 
I am another image and vision of another survivor of war. 
I am that refugee, and I am that girl. 
You see, I grew up in war-torn Iraq, and I believe that there are two sides of wars and we've only seen one side of it. 
We only talk about one side of it. 
But there's another side that I have witnessed as someone who lived in it and someone who ended up working in it. 
I grew up with the colors of war -- the red colors of fire and blood, the brown tones of earth as it explodes in our faces and the piercing silver of an exploded missile, so bright that nothing can protect your eyes from it. 
I grew up with the sounds of war -- the staccato sounds of gunfire, the wrenching booms of explosions, ominous drones of jets flying overhead and the wailing warning sounds of sirens. 
These are the sounds you would expect, but they are also the sounds of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds screeching in the night, the high-pitched honest cries of children and the thunderous, unbearable silence. 
"War," a friend of mine said, "is not about sound at all. 
It is actually about silence, the silence of humanity." 
I have since left Iraq and founded a group called Women for Women International that ends up working with women survivors of wars. 
In my travels and in my work, from Congo to Afghanistan, from Sudan to Rwanda, I have learned not only that the colors and the sounds of war are the same, but the fears of war are the same. 
You know, there is a fear of dying, and do not believe any movie character where the hero is not afraid. 
It is very scary to go through that feeling of "I am about to die" or "I could die in this explosion." 
But there's also the fear of losing loved ones, and I think that's even worse. 
It's too painful. You don't want to think about it. 
But I think the worst kind of fear is the fear -- as Samia, a Bosnian woman, once told me, who survived the four-years besiege of Sarajevo; she said, "The fear of losing the 'I' in me, the fear of losing the 'I' in me." 
That's what my mother in Iraq used to tell me. 
It's like dying from inside-out. 
A Palestinian woman once told me, "It is not about the fear of one death," she said, "sometimes I feel I die 10 times in one day," as she was describing the marches of soldiers and the sounds of their bullets. 
She said, "But it's not fair, because there is only one life, and there should only be one death." 
We have been only seeing one side of war. 
We have only been discussing and consumed with high-level preoccupations over troop levels, drawdown timelines, surges and sting operations, when we should be examining the details of where the social fabric has been most torn, where the community has improvised and survived and shown acts of resilience and amazing courage just to keep life going. 
We have been so consumed with seemingly objective discussions of politics, tactics, weapons, dollars and casualties. 
This is the language of sterility. 
How casually we treat casualties in the context of this topic. 
This is where we conceive of rape and casualties as inevitabilities. 
Eighty percent of refugees around the world are women and children. Oh. 
Ninety percent of modern war casualties are civilians. 
Seventy-five percent of them are women and children. 
How interesting. 
Oh, half a million women in Rwanda get raped in 100 days. 
Or, as we speak now, hundreds of thousands of Congolese women are getting raped and mutilated. 
How interesting. 
These just become numbers that we refer to. 
The front of wars is increasingly non-human eyes peering down on our perceived enemies from space, guiding missiles toward unseen targets, while the human conduct of the orchestra of media relations in the event that this particular drone attack hits a villager instead of an extremist. 
It is a chess game. 
You learn to play an international relations school on your way out and up to national and international leadership. 
Checkmate. 
We are missing a completely other side of wars. 
We are missing my mother's story, who made sure with every siren, with every raid, with every cut off-of electricity, she played puppet shows for my brothers and I, so we would not be scared of the sounds of explosions. 
We are missing the story of Fareeda, a music teacher, a piano teacher, in Sarajevo, who made sure that she kept the music school open every single day in the four years of besiege in Sarajevo and walked to that school, despite the snipers shooting at that school and at her, and kept the piano, the violin, the cello playing the whole duration of the war, with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats. 
That was her fight. 
That was her resistance. 
We are missing the story of Nehia, a Palestinian woman in Gaza who, the minute there was a cease-fire in the last year's war, she left out of home, collected all the flour and baked as much bread for every neighbor to have, in case there is no cease-fire the day after. 
We are missing the stories of Violet, who, despite surviving genocide in the church massacre, she kept on going on, burying bodies, cleaning homes, cleaning the streets. 
We are missing stories of women who are literally keeping life going in the midst of wars. 
Do you know -- do you know that people fall in love in war and go to school and go to factories and hospitals and get divorced and go dancing and go playing and live life going? 
And the ones who are keeping that life are women. 
There are two sides of war. 
There is a side that fights, and there is a side that keeps the schools and the factories and the hospitals open. 
There is a side that is focused on winning battles, and there is a side that is focused on winning life. 
There is a side that leads the front-line discussion, and there is a side that leads the back-line discussion. 
There is a side that thinks that peace is the end of fighting, and there is a side that thinks that peace is the arrival of schools and jobs. 
There is a side that is led by men, and there is a side that is led by women. 
And in order for us to understand how do we build lasting peace, we must understand war and peace from both sides. 
We must have a full picture of what that means. 
In order for us to understand what actually peace means, we need to understand, as one Sudanese woman once told me, "Peace is the fact that my toenails are growing back again." 
She grew up in Sudan, in Southern Sudan, for 20 years of war, where it killed one million people and displaced five million refugees. 
Many women were taken as slaves by rebels and soldiers, as sexual slaves who were forced also to carry the ammunition and the water and the food for the soldiers. 
So that woman walked for 20 years, so she would not be kidnapped again. 
And only when there was some sort of peace, her toenails grew back again. 
We need to understand peace from a toenail's perspective. 
We need to understand that we cannot actually have negotiations of ending of wars or peace without fully including women at the negotiating table. 
I find it amazing that the only group of people who are not fighting and not killing and not pillaging and not burning and not raping, and the group of people who are mostly -- though not exclusively -- who are keeping life going in the midst of war, are not included in the negotiating table. 
And I do argue that women lead the back-line discussion, but there are also men who are excluded from that discussion. 
The doctors who are not fighting, the artists, the students, the men who refuse to pick up the guns, they are, too, excluded from the negotiating tables. 
There is no way we can talk about a lasting peace, building of democracy, sustainable economies, any kind of stabilities, if we do not fully include women at the negotiating table. 
Not one, but 50 percent. 
There is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we don't start investing in women and girls. 
Did you know that one year of the world's military spending equals 700 years of the U.N. budget and equals 2,928 years of the U.N. budget allocated for women? 
If we just reverse that distribution of funds, perhaps we could have a better lasting peace in this world. 
And last, but not least, we need to invest in peace and women, not only because it is the right thing to do, not only because it is the right thing to do, for all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today, but it is for the future. 
A Congolese woman, who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them and saw her raped in front of them and mutilated in front of them, and her children saw their nine-year-old sibling killed in front of them, how they're doing okay right now. 
She got into Women for Women International's program. 
She got a support network. 
She learned about her rights. 
We taught her vocational and business skills. We helped her get a job. 
She was earning 450 dollars. She was doing okay. 
She was sending them to school. Have a new home. 
She said, "But what I worry about the most is not any of that. 
I worry that my children have hate in their hearts, and when they want to grow up, they want to fight again the killers of their father and their brother." 
We need to invest in women, because that's our only chance to ensure that there is no more war in the future. 
That mother has a better chance to heal her children than any peace agreement can do. 
Are there good news? Of course, there are good news. There are lots of good news. 
To start with, these women that I told you about are dancing and singing every single day, and if they can, who are we not to dance? 
That girl that I told you about ended up starting Women for Women International Group that impacted one million people, sent 80 million dollars, and I started this from zero, nothing, nada, [unclear]. 
(Laughter) They are women who are standing on their feet in spite of their circumstances, not because of it. 
Think of how the world can be a much better place if, for a change, we have a better equality, we have equality, we have a representation and we understand war, both from the front-line and the back-line discussion. 
Rumi, a 13th-century Sufi poet, says, "Out beyond the worlds of right-doings and wrong-doings, there is a field. 
I will meet you there. 
When the soul lies down in that grass, the world is too full to talk about. 
Ideas, language, even the phrase 'each other' no longer makes any sense." 
I humbly add -- humbly add -- that out beyond the worlds of war and peace, there is a field, and there are many women and men [who] are meeting there. 
Let us make this field a much bigger place. 
Let us all meet in that field. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So I'm going to talk about work; specifically, why people can't seem to get work done at work, which is a problem we all kind of have. 
But let's sort of start at the beginning. 
So, we have companies and non-profits and charities and all these groups that have employees or volunteers of some sort. 
And they expect these people who work for them to do great work -- I would hope, at least. 
At least good work, hopefully, at least it's good work -- hopefully great work. 
And so what they typically do is they decide that all these people need to come together in one place to do that work. 
So a company, or a charity, or an organization of any kind, unless you're working in Africa, if you're really lucky to do that -- most people have to go to an office every day. 
And so these companies, they build offices. 
They go out and they buy a building, or they rent a building, or they lease some space, and they fill this space with stuff. 
They fill it with tables, or desks, chairs, computer equipment, software, Internet access, maybe a fridge, maybe a few other things, and they expect their employees, or their volunteers, to come to that location every day to do great work. 
It seems like it's perfectly reasonable to ask that. 
However, if you actually talk to people and even question yourself, and you ask yourself, where do you really want to go when you really need to get something done? 
You'll find out that people don't say what businesses think they would say. 
If you ask people the question: Where do you need to go when you need to get something done? 
Typically, you get three different kinds of answers. 
One is kind of a place or a location or a room. 
Another one is a moving object, and a third is a time. 
So here are some examples. 
I've been asking people this question for about 10 years: "Where do you go when you really need to get something done?" 
I'll hear things like, the porch, the deck, the kitchen. 
I'll hear things like an extra room in the house, the basement, the coffee shop, the library. 
And then you'll hear things like the train, a plane, a car -- so, the commute. 
And then you'll hear people say, "Well, it doesn't really matter where I am, as long as it's early in the morning or late at night or on the weekends." 
You almost never hear someone say, "The office." 
But businesses are spending all this money on this place called the office, and they're making people go to it all the time, yet people don't do work in the office. 
What is that about? 
(Laughter) Why is that? Why is that happening? 
And what you find out is, if you dig a little bit deeper, you find out that people -- this is what happens: People go to work, and they're basically trading in their work day for a series of "work moments" -- that's what happens at the office. 
You don't have a work day anymore. You have work moments. 
It's like the front door of the office is like a Cuisinart, and you walk in and your day is shredded to bits, because you have 15 minutes here, 30 minutes there, and something else happens, you're pulled off your work, then you have 20 minutes, then it's lunch, then you have something else to do ... 
Then you've got 15 minutes, and someone pulls you aside and asks you a question, and before you know it, it's 5 p.m., and you look back on the day, and you realize that you didn't get anything done. 
We've all been through this. 
We probably went through it yesterday or the day before, or the day before that. 
You look back on your day, and you're like, "I got nothing done today. 
I was at work. I sat at my desk. I used my expensive computer. 
I used the software they told me to use. 
I went to these meetings I was asked to go to. 
I did these conference calls. I did all this stuff. 
But I didn't actually do anything. 
I just did tasks. 
I didn't actually get meaningful work done." 
And what you find is that, especially with creative people -- designers, programmers, writers, engineers, thinkers -- that people really need long stretches of uninterrupted time to get something done. 
You cannot ask somebody to be creative in 15 minutes and really think about a problem. 
You might have a quick idea, but to be in deep thought about a problem and really consider a problem carefully, you need long stretches of uninterrupted time. 
And even though the work day is typically eight hours, how many people here have ever had eight hours to themselves at the office? 
How about seven hours? 
Six? Five? Four? 
When's the last time you had three hours to yourself at the office? 
Two hours? One, maybe? 
Very, very few people actually have long stretches of uninterrupted time at an office. 
And this is why people choose to do work at home, or they might go to the office, but they might go to the office really early in the day, or late at night when no one's around, or they stick around after everyone's left, or go in on the weekends, or they get work done on the plane, in the car or in the train, because there are no distractions. 
Now there are different kinds of distractions, but not the really bad distractions, which I'll talk about in a minute. 
And this whole phenomenon of having short bursts of time to get things done reminds me of another thing that doesn't work when you're interrupted, and that is sleep. 
I think that sleep and work are very closely related -- not because you can work while you're sleeping and sleep while you're working. 
That's not really what I mean. 
I'm talking specifically about the fact that sleep and work are phase-based, or stage-based, events. 
Sleep is about sleep phases, or stages -- some people call them different things. 
There are five of them, and in order to get to the really deep ones, the meaningful ones, you have to go through the early ones. 
If you're interrupted while you're going through the early ones -- if someone bumps you in bed, or there's a sound, or whatever happens -- you don't just pick up where you left off. 
If you're interrupted and woken up, you have to start again. 
So you have to go back a few phases and start again. 
And what ends up happening -- you might have days like this where you wake up at eight or seven in the morning, or whenever you get up, and you're like, "I didn't sleep very well. 
I did the sleep thing -- I went to bed, I laid down, but I didn't really sleep." 
People say you go "to" sleep, but you don't go to sleep, you go towards sleep; it takes a while. 
You've got to go through phases and stuff, and if you're interrupted, you don't sleep well. 
So does anyone here expect someone to sleep well if they're interrupted all night? 
I don't think anyone would say yes. 
Why do we expect people to work well if they're being interrupted all day at the office? 
How can we possibly expect people to do their job if they go to the office and are interrupted? 
That doesn't really seem like it makes a lot of sense, to me. 
So what are the interruptions that happen at the office but not at other places? 
Because in other places, you can have interruptions like the TV, or you could go for a walk, or there's a fridge downstairs, or you've got your own couch, or whatever you want to do. 
If you talk to certain managers, they'll tell you that they don't want their employees to work at home because of these distractions. 
They'll sometimes also say, "If I can't see the person, how do I know they're working?" 
which is ridiculous, but that's one of the excuses that managers give. 
And I'm one of these managers. I understand. I know how this goes. 
We all have to improve on this sort of thing. 
But oftentimes they'll cite distractions: "I can't let someone work at home. 
They'll watch TV, or do this other thing." 
It turns out those aren't the things that are distracting, Because those are voluntary distractions. 
You decide when you want to be distracted by the TV, when you want to turn something on, or when you want to go downstairs or go for a walk. 
At the office, most of the interruptions and distractions that really cause people not to get work done are involuntary. 
So let's go through a couple of those. 
Now, managers and bosses will often have you think that the real distractions at work are things like Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and other websites, and in fact, they'll go so far as to actually ban these sites at work. 
Some of you may work at places where you can't get to certain sites. 
I mean, is this China? What the hell is going on here? 
You can't go to a website at work, and that's the problem? 
That's why people aren't getting work done, because they're on Facebook and Twitter? 
That's kind of ridiculous. It's a total decoy. 
Today's Facebook and Twitter and YouTube, these things are just modern-day smoke breaks. 
No one cared about letting people take a smoke break for 15 minutes 10 years ago, so why does anyone care if someone goes to Facebook or Twitter or YouTube here and there? 
Those aren't the real problems in the office. 
The real problems are what I like to call the M&amp;Ms, the Managers and the Meetings. 
Those are the real problems in the modern office today. 
And this is why things don't get done at work, it's because of the M&amp;Ms. 
Now what's interesting is, if you listen to all the places that people talk about doing work, like at home, in the car, on a plane, late at night, or early in the morning, you don't find managers and meetings. 
You find a lot of other distractions, but not managers and meetings. 
So these are the things that you don't find elsewhere, but you do find at the office. 
And managers are basically people whose job it is to interrupt people. 
That's pretty much what managers are for. They're for interrupting people. 
They don't really do the work, so they make sure everyone else is doing work, which is an interruption. 
We have lots of managers in the world now, and a lot of people in the world, and a lot of interruptions by these managers. 
They have to check in: "Hey, how's it going? 
Show me what's up." This sort of thing. 
They keep interrupting you at the wrong time, while you're actually trying to do something they're paying you to do, they tend to interrupt you. 
That's kind of bad. 
But what's even worse is the thing that managers do most of all, which is call meetings. 
And meetings are just toxic, terrible, poisonous things during the day at work. 
(Laughter) We all know this to be true, and you would never see a spontaneous meeting called by employees. 
It doesn't work that way. 
The manager calls the meeting so the employees can all come together, and it's an incredibly disruptive thing to do to people -- to say, "Hey look, we're going to bring 10 people together right now and have a meeting. 
I don't care what you're doing, you've got to stop doing it, so you can have this meeting." 
I mean, what are the chances that all 10 people are ready to stop? 
What if they're thinking about something important, or doing important work? 
All of a sudden you tell them they have to stop doing that to do something else. 
So they go into a meeting room, they get together, and they talk about stuff that doesn't really matter, usually. 
Because meetings aren't work. 
Meetings are places to go to talk about things you're supposed to be doing later. 
But meetings also procreate. 
So one meeting tends to lead to another meeting, which leads to another meeting. 
There's often too many people in the meetings, and they're very, very expensive to the organization. 
Companies often think of a one-hour meeting as a one-hour meeting, but that's not true, unless there's only one person. 
If there are 10 people, it's a 10-hour meeting, not a one-hour meeting. 
It's 10 hours of productivity taken from the rest of the organization to have this one-hour meeting, which probably should have been handled by two or three people talking for a few minutes. 
But instead, there's a long scheduled meeting, because meetings are scheduled the way software works, which is in increments of 15 minutes, or 30 minutes, or an hour. 
You don't schedule an eight-hour meeting with Outlook; you can't. 
You can go 15 minutes or 30 minutes or 45 minutes or an hour. 
And so we tend to fill these times up when things should go really quickly. 
So meetings and managers are two major problems in businesses today, especially at offices. 
These things don't exist outside of the office. 
So I have some suggestions to remedy the situation. 
What can managers do -- enlightened managers, hopefully -- what can they do to make the office a better place for people to work, so it's not the last resort, but it's the first resort, so that people start to say, "When I really want to get stuff done, I go to the office." 
Because the offices are well-equipped; everything is there for them to do the work. 
But they don't want to go there right now, so how do we change that? 
I have three suggestions to share with you. 
We've all heard of the Casual Friday thing. 
I don't know if people still do that. 
But how about "No-talk Thursdays?" 
(Laughter) Pick one Thursday once a month, and cut it in half, just the afternoon -- I'll make it easy for you. 
So just the afternoon, one Thursday. 
First Thursday of the month, just the afternoon, nobody in the office can talk to each other. 
Just silence, that's it. 
And what you'll find is that a tremendous amount of work gets done when no one talks to each other. 
This is when people actually get stuff done, is when no one's bothering them or interrupting them. 
Giving someone four hours of uninterrupted time is the best gift you can give anybody at work. 
It's better than a computer, better than a new monitor, better than new software, or whatever people typically use. 
Giving them four hours of quiet time at the office is going to be incredibly valuable. 
If you try that, I think you'll agree, and hopefully you can do it more often. 
So maybe it's every other week, or every week, once a week, afternoons no one can talk to each other. 
That's something that you'll find will really, really work. 
Another thing you can try, is switching from active communication and collaboration, which is like face-to-face stuff -- tapping people on the shoulder, saying hi to them, having meetings, and replace that with more passive models of communication, using things like email and instant messaging, or collaboration products, things like that. 
Now some people might say email is really distracting, I.M. is really distracting, and these other things are really distracting, but they're distracting at a time of your own choice and your own choosing. 
You can quit the email app; you can't quit your boss. 
You can quit I.M.; you can't hide your manager. 
You can put these things away, and then you can be interrupted on your own schedule, at your own time, when you're available, when you're ready to go again. 
Because work, like sleep, happens in phases. 
So you'll be going up, doing some work, and then you'll come down from that work, and then maybe it's time to check that email or I.M. 
There are very, very few things that are that urgent, that need to happen, that need to be answered right this second. 
So if you're a manager, start encouraging people to use more things like I.M. and email and other things that someone can put away and then get back to you on their own schedule. 
And the last suggestion I have is that, if you do have a meeting coming up, if you have the power, just cancel it. 
(Laughter) Today's Friday, usually people have meetings on Monday. 
Just don't have it. 
I don't mean move it; I mean just erase it from memory, it's gone. 
And you'll find out that everything will be just fine. 
All these discussions and decisions you thought you had to make at this one time at 9 a.m. on Monday, just forget about them, and things will be fine. 
You'll find out all these things you thought you had to do, you don't actually have to do. 
So those are just three quick suggestions I wanted to give you guys to think about. 
I hope that some of these ideas were at least provocative enough for managers and bosses and business owners and organizers and people who are in charge of other people, to think about laying off a little bit, and giving people more time to get work done. 
I think it'll all pay off in the end. 
So, thanks for listening. 
(Applause) 

(Applause) Thank you very much. 
I have a few pictures, and I'll talk a little bit about how I'm able to do what I do. 
All these houses are built from between 70 and 80 percent recycled material, stuff that was headed to the mulcher, the landfill, the burn pile. 
It was all just gone. 
This is the first house I built. 
This double front door here with the three-light transom, that was headed to the landfill. 
Have a little turret there. 
And then these buttons on the corbels here -- right there -- those are hickory nuts. 
And these buttons there -- those are chicken eggs. 
(Laughter) Of course, first you have breakfast, and then you fill the shell full of Bondo and paint it and nail it up, and you have an architectural button in just a fraction of the time. 
This is a look at the inside. 
You can see the three-light transom there with the eyebrow windows. 
Certainly an architectural antique headed to the landfill -- even the lockset is probably worth 200 dollars. 
Everything in the kitchen was salvaged. 
There's a 1952 O'Keefe &amp; Merritt stove, if you like to cook -- cool stove. 
This is going up into the turret. 
I got that staircase for 20 dollars, including delivery to my lot. 
(Laughter) Then, looking up in the turret, you see there are bulges and pokes and sags and so forth. 
Well, if that ruins your life, well, then, you shouldn't live there. 
(Laughter) This is a laundry chute. 
And this right here is a shoe last -- those are those cast-iron things you see at antique shops. 
So I had one of those, so I made some low-tech gadgetry, where you just stomp on the shoe last, and then the door flies open and you throw your laundry down. 
And then if you're smart enough, it goes on a basket on top of the washer. 
If not, it goes into the toilet. 
(Laughter) This is a bathtub I made, made out of scrap two-by-four. 
Started with the rim, and then glued and nailed it up into a flat, corbeled it up and flipped it over, then did the two profiles on this side. 
It's a two-person tub. 
After all, it's not just a question of hygiene, but there's a possibility of recreation as well. 
(Laughter) Then, this faucet here is just a piece of Osage orange. 
It looks a little phallic, but after all, it's a bathroom. 
(Laughter) This is a house based on a Budweiser can. 
It doesn't look like a can of beer, but the design take-offs are absolutely unmistakable: the barley hops design worked up into the eaves, then the dentil work comes directly off the can's red, white, blue and silver. 
Then, these corbels going down underneath the eaves are that little design that comes off the can. 
I just put a can on a copier and kept enlarging it until I got the size I want. 
Then, on the can it says, "This is the famous Budweiser beer, we know of no other beer, blah, blah, blah." 
So we changed that and put, "This is the famous Budweiser house. We don't know of any other house ..." 
This is a deadbolt. 
It's a fence from a 1930s shaper, which is a very angry woodworking machine. 
And they gave me the fence, but they didn't give me the shaper, so we made a deadbolt out of it. 
That'll keep bull elephants out, I promise. 
(Laughter) And sure enough, we've had no problems with bull elephants. 
(Laughter) The shower is intended to simulate a glass of beer. 
We've got bubbles going up there, then suds at the top with lumpy tiles. 
Where do you get lumpy tiles? Well, of course, you don't. 
But I get a lot of toilets, and so you just dispatch a toilet with a hammer, and then you have lumpy tiles. 
And then the faucet is a beer tap. 
(Laughter) Then, this panel of glass is the same panel of glass that occurs in every middle-class front door in America. 
We're getting tired of it. It's kind of clichéd now. 
If you put it in the front door, your design fails. 
So don't put it in the front door; put it somewhere else. 
It's a pretty panel of glass. 
But if you put it in the front door, people say, "Oh, you're trying to be like those guys, and you didn't make it." 
Then, another bathroom upstairs. 
This light up here is the same light that occurs in every middle-class foyer in America. 
Don't put it in the foyer. 
Put it in the shower, or in the closet, but not in the foyer. 
Then, somebody gave me a bidet, so it got a bidet. 
(Laughter) This little house here, those branches there are made out of Bois d'arc or Osage orange. 
These pictures will keep scrolling as I talk a little bit. 
In order to do what I do, you have to understand what causes waste in the building industry. 
Our housing has become a commodity, and I'll talk a little bit about that. 
But the first cause of waste is probably even buried in our DNA. 
Human beings have a need for maintaining consistency of the apperceptive mass. 
What does that mean? 
What it means is, for every perception we have, it needs to tally with the one like it before, or we don't have continuity, and we become a little bit disoriented. 
So I can show you an object you've never seen before. 
Oh, that's a cell phone. 
But you've never seen this one before. 
What you're doing is sizing up the pattern of structural features, and then you go through your databanks: Cell phone. Oh! That's a cell phone. 
If I took a bite out of it, you'd go, "Wait a second. 
(Laughter) "That's not a cell phone. 
That's one of those new chocolate cell phones." 
(Laughter) You'd have to start a new category, right between cell phones and chocolate. 
(Laughter) That's how we process information. 
You translate that to the building industry. 
If we have a wall of windowpanes and one pane is cracked, we go, "Oh, dear. That's cracked. Let's repair it. 
Let's take it out and throw it away so nobody can use it and put a new one in." 
Because that's what you do with a cracked pane. 
It only rattles that expected pattern and unity of structural features. 
However, if we took a small hammer, and we added cracks to all the other windows -- (Laughter) then we have a pattern. 
Because Gestalt psychology emphasizes recognition of pattern over parts that comprise a pattern. 
We'll go, "Ooh, that's nice." 
So, that serves me every day. 
Repetition creates pattern. 
If I have 100 of these, 100 of those, it makes no difference what these and those are. 
If I can repeat anything, I have the possibility of a pattern, from hickory nuts and chicken eggs, shards of glass, branches. 
It doesn't make any difference. 
That causes a lot of waste in the building industry. 
The second cause is, Friedrich Nietzsche, along about 1885, wrote a book titled "The Birth of Tragedy." 
And in there, he said cultures tend to swing between one of two perspectives: on the one hand, we have an Apollonian perspective, which is very crisp and premeditated and intellectualized and perfect. 
On the other end of the spectrum, we have a Dionysian perspective, which is more given to the passions and intuition, tolerant of organic texture and human gesture. 
So the way the Apollonian personality takes a picture or hangs a picture is, they'll get out a transit and a laser level and a micrometer. 
"OK, honey. A thousandth of an inch to the left. 
That's where we want the picture. Right. Perfect!" 
The Dionysian personality takes the picture and goes: (Laughter) That's the difference. 
I feature organic process. 
Dead center John Dewey. 
Apollonian mindset creates mountains of waste. 
If something isn't perfect, if it doesn't line up with that premeditated model? 
Dumpster. 
"Oops. Scratch. Dumpster." 
"Oops" this, "oops" that. Landfill, landfill, landfill. 
The third thing is arguably -- The Industrial Revolution started in the Renaissance with the rise of humanism, then got a little jump start along about the French Revolution. 
By the middle of the 19th century, it's in full flower. 
And we have dumaflaches and gizmos and contraptions that will do anything that we, up to that point, had to do by hand. 
So now we have standardized materials. 
Well, trees don't grow two inches by four inches, eight, ten and twelve feet tall. 
(Laughter) We create mountains of waste. 
And they're doing a pretty good job there in the forest, working all the byproduct of their industry -- with OSB and particle board and so forth and so on -- but it does no good to be responsible at the point of harvest in the forest if consumers are wasting the harvest at the point of consumption. 
And that's what's happening. 
And so if something isn't standard, "Oops, dumpster." "Oops" this. "Oops, warped." 
If you buy a two-by-four and it's not straight, you can take it back. 
"Oh, I'm so sorry, sir. We'll get you a straight one." 
Well, I feature all those warped things because repetition creates pattern, and it's from a Dionysian perspective. 
The fourth thing is labor is disproportionately more expensive than materials. 
Well, that's just a myth. 
And there's a story: Jim Tulles, one of the guys I trained -- I said, "Jim, it's time now. 
I got a job for you as a foreman on a framing crew. Time for you to go." 
"Dan, I just don't think I'm ready." 
"Jim, now it's time. You're the down -- oh!" 
So we hired on. 
And he was out there with a tape measure, going through the trash heap, looking for header material, or the board that goes over a door, thinking he'd impress his boss -- that's how we taught him to do it. 
The superintendent walked up and said, "What are you doing?" 
"Oh, just looking for header material," waiting for that kudos. 
He said, "I'm not paying you to go through the trash. Get back to work." 
And Jim had the wherewithal to say, "You know, if you were paying me 300 dollars an hour, I can see how you might say that. 
But right now, I'm saving you five dollars a minute. 
Do the math." 
(Laughter) "Good call, Tulles. From now on, you guys hit this pile first." 
And the irony is that he wasn't very good at math. 
(Laughter) But once in a while, you get access to the control room, and then you can kind of mess with the dials. 
The fifth thing is that maybe, after 2,500 years, Plato is still having his way with us in his notion of perfect forms. 
He said that we have in our noggin the perfect idea of what we want, and we force environmental resources to accommodate that. 
So we all have in our head the perfect house, the American dream, which is a house, the dream house. 
So we have the American dream look-alike, which is a mobile home. 
Now there's a blight on the planet. 
(Laughter) It's a chattel mortgage, just like furniture, just like a car. 
You write the check, and instantly, it depreciates 30 percent. 
After a year, you can't get insurance on everything you have in it, only on 70 percent. 
Nothing wrong with that, unless you ask it to do what 12-Gauge wire's supposed to do, and that's what happens. 
It out-gasses formaldehyde -- so much so that there is a federal law in place to warn new mobile home buyers of the formaldehyde atmosphere danger. 
Are we just being numbingly stupid? 
The walls are this thick. 
The whole thing has the structural value of corn. 
(Laughter) "So ... I thought Palm Harbor Village was over there." 
"No, no. We had a wind last night. 
It's gone now." 
(Laughter) Then when they degrade, what do you do with them? 
Now, all that -- that Apollonian, Platonic model -- is what the building industry is predicated on, and there are a number of things that exacerbate that. 
One is that all the professionals, all the tradesmen, vendors, inspectors, engineers, architects all think like this. 
And then it works its way back to the consumer, who demands the same model. 
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. We can't get out of it. 
Then here come the marketeers and the advertisers. 
"Woo. Woo-hoo." 
We buy stuff we didn't know we needed. 
All we have to do is look at what one company did with carbonated prune juice. 
(Laughter) But you know what they did? 
They hooked a metaphor into it and said, "I drink Dr. Pepper ..." 
And pretty soon, we're swilling that stuff by the lake-ful, by the billions of gallons. 
It doesn't even have real prunes! Doesn't even keep you regular. 
(Laughter) My oh my, that makes it worse. 
And we get sucked into that faster than anything. 
Then, a man named Jean-Paul Sartre wrote a book titled "Being and Nothingness." 
It's a pretty quick read. You can snap through it in maybe -- (Laughter) maybe two years, if you read eight hours a day. 
In there, he talked about the divided self. 
He said human beings act differently when they know they're alone than when they know somebody else is around. 
So if I'm eating spaghetti, and I know I'm alone, I can eat like a backhoe. 
I can wipe my mouth on my sleeve, napkin on the table, chew with my mouth open, make little noises, scratch wherever I want. 
(Laughter) But as soon as you walk in, I go, "Oops! Lil' spaghetti sauce there." 
Napkin in my lap, half-bites, chew with my mouth closed, no scratching. 
Now, what I'm doing is fulfilling your expectations of how I should live my life. 
I feel that expectation, and so I accommodate it, and I'm living my life according to what you expect me to do. 
That happens in the building industry as well. 
That's why all subdivisions look the same. 
Sometimes, we even have these formalized cultural expectations. 
I'll bet all your shoes match. 
Sure enough, we all buy into that ... 
(Laughter) And with gated communities, we have a formalized expectation, with a homeowners' association. 
Sometimes those guys are Nazis, my oh my. 
That exacerbates and continues this model. 
The last thing is gregariousness. 
Human beings are a social species. 
We like to hang together in groups, just like wildebeests, just like lions. 
Wildebeests don't hang with lions, because lions eat wildebeests. 
Human beings are like that. 
We do what that group does that we're trying to identify with. 
You see this in junior high a lot. 
Those kids, they'll work all summer long -- kill themselves -- so that they can afford one pair of designer jeans. 
So along about September, they can stride in and go, "I'm important today. See? Don't touch my designer jeans! 
I see you don't have designer jeans. 
You're not one of the beautiful -- See, I'm one of the beautiful people. 
See my jeans?" 
Right there is reason enough to have uniforms. 
And so that happens in the building industry as well. 
We have confused Maslow's hierarchy of needs, just a little bit. 
On the bottom tier, we have basic needs: shelter, clothing, food, water, mating and so forth. 
Second: security. Third: relationships. 
Fourth: status, self-esteem -- that is, vanity -- and we're taking vanity and shoving it down here. 
And so we end up with vain decisions, and we can't even afford our mortgage. 
We can't afford to eat anything except beans; that is, our housing has become a commodity. 
And it takes a little bit of nerve to dive into those primal, terrifying parts of ourselves and make our own decisions and not make our housing a commodity, but make it something that bubbles up from seminal sources. 
That takes a little bit of nerve, and, darn it, once in a while, you fail. 
But that's okay. 
If failure destroys you, then you can't do this. 
I fail all the time, every day, and I've had some whopping failures, I promise -- big, public, humiliating, embarrassing failures. 
Everybody points and laughs, and they say, "He tried it a fifth time, and it still didn't work! 
What a moron!" 
Early on, contractors come by and say, "Dan, you're a cute little bunny, but you know, this just isn't going to work. 
What don't you do this? Why don't you do that?" 
And your instinct is to say, "Well, why don't you suck an egg?" 
(Laughter) But you don't say that, because they're the guys you're targeting. 
And so what we've done -- and this isn't just in housing; it's in clothing and food and our transportation needs, our energy -- we sprawl just a little bit. 
And when I get a little bit of press, I hear from people all over the world. 
And we may have invented excess, but the problem of waste is worldwide. 
We're in trouble. 
And I don't wear ammo belts crisscrossing my chest and a red bandana. 
But we're clearly in trouble. 
And what we need to do is reconnect with those really primal parts of ourselves and make some decisions and say, "You know, I think I would like to put CDs across the wall there. 
What do you think, honey?" 
If it doesn't work, take it down. 
What we need to do is reconnect with who we really are, and that's thrilling indeed. 
Thank you very much. 

Hello. My name is Birke Baehr, and I'm 11 years old. 
I came here today to talk about what's wrong with our food system. 
First of all, I would like to say that I'm really amazed at how easily kids are led to believe all the marketing and advertising on TV, at public schools and pretty much everywhere else you look. 
It seems to me like corporations are always trying to get kids, like me, to get their parents to buy stuff that really isn't good for us or the planet. 
Little kids, especially, are attracted by colorful packaging and plastic toys. 
I must admit, I used to be one of them. 
I also used to think that all of our food came from these happy, little farms where pigs rolled in mud and cows grazed on grass all day. 
What I discovered was this is not true. 
I began to look into this stuff on the Internet, in books and in documentary films, in my travels with my family. 
I discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system. 
First, there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms. 
That is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory to do something not intended by nature -- like taking the DNA of a fish and putting it into the DNA of a tomato. Yuck. 
Don't get me wrong, I like fish and tomatoes, but this is just creepy. 
(Laughter) The seeds are then planted, then grown. 
The food they produce have been proven to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals, and people have been eating food produced this way since the 1990s. 
And most folks don't even know they exist. 
Did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity? 
These include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight. 
Yet almost all the corn we eat has been altered genetically in some way. 
And let me tell you, corn is in everything. 
And don't even get me started on the Confined Animal Feeding Operations called CAFOS. 
(Laughter) Conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers made from fossil fuels that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow. 
They do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients from growing the same crop over and over again. 
Next, more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables, like pesticides and herbicides, to kill weeds and bugs. 
When it rains, these chemicals seep into the ground, or run off into our waterways, poisoning our water too. 
Then they irradiate our food, trying to make it last longer, so it can travel thousands of miles from where it's grown to the supermarkets. 
So I ask myself, how can I change? How can I change these things? 
This is what I found out. 
I discovered that there's a movement for a better way. 
Now a while back, I wanted to be an NFL football player. 
I decided that I'd rather be an organic farmer instead. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
And that way I can have a greater impact on the world. 
This man, Joel Salatin, they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system. 
Since I'm home-schooled, I went to go hear him speak one day. 
This man, this "lunatic farmer," doesn't use any pesticides, herbicides, or genetically modified seeds. 
And so for that, he's called crazy by the system. 
I want you to know that we can all make a difference by making different choices, by buying our food directly from local farmers, or our neighbors who we know in real life. 
Some people say organic or local food is more expensive, but is it really? 
With all these things I've been learning about the food system, it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer, or we can pay the hospital. 
(Applause) Now I know definitely which one I would choose. 
I want you to know that there are farms out there -- like Bill Keener in Sequatchie Cove Farm in Tennessee -- whose cows do eat grass and whose pigs do roll in the mud, just like I thought. 
Sometimes I go to Bill's farm and volunteer, so I can see up close and personal where the meat I eat comes from. 
I want you to know that I believe kids will eat fresh vegetables and good food if they know more about it and where it really comes from. 
I want you to know that there are farmers' markets in every community popping up. 
I want you to know that me, my brother and sister actually like eating baked kale chips. 
I try to share this everywhere I go. 
Not too long ago, my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal. 
He asked him if he wanted organic Toasted O's or the sugarcoated flakes -- you know, the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front. 
My little cousin told his dad that he would rather have the organic Toasted O's cereal because Birke said he shouldn't eat sparkly cereal. 
And that, my friends, is how we can make a difference one kid at a time. 
So next time you're at the grocery store, think local, choose organic, know your farmer and know your food. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Well, the subject of difficult negotiation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the Middle East, of a man who left to his three sons, 17 camels. 
To the first son, he left half the camels; to the second son, he left a third of the camels; and to the youngest son, he left a ninth of the camels. 
The three sons got into a negotiation -- 17 doesn't divide by two. 
It doesn't divide by three. 
It doesn't divide by nine. 
Brotherly tempers started to get strained. 
Finally, in desperation, they went and they consulted a wise old woman. 
The wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time, and finally she came back and said, "Well, I don't know if I can help you, but at least, if you want, you can have my camel." 
So then, they had 18 camels. 
The second son took his third -- a third of 18 is six. 
The youngest son took his ninth -- a ninth of 18 is two. 
You get 17. 
They had one camel left over. 
They gave it back to the wise old woman. 
(Laughter) Now, if you think about that story for a moment, I think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in. 
They start off like 17 camels, no way to resolve it. 
Somehow, what we need to do is step back from those situations, like that wise old woman, look at the situation through fresh eyes and come up with an 18th camel. 
Finding that 18th camel in the world's conflicts has been my life passion. 
I basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers. 
We're all one family. 
We know that scientifically, thanks to the communications revolution, all the tribes on the planet -- all 15,000 tribes -- are in touch with each other. 
And it's a big family reunion. 
And yet, like many family reunions, it's not all peace and light. 
There's a lot of conflict, and the question is: How do we deal with our differences? 
How do we deal with our deepest differences, given the human propensity for conflict and the human genius at devising weapons of enormous destruction? 
That's the question. 
As I've spent the last better part of three decades, almost four, traveling the world, trying to work, getting involved in conflicts ranging from Yugoslavia to the Middle East to Chechnya to Venezuela -- some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet -- I've been asking myself that question. 
And I think I've found, in some ways, what is the secret to peace. 
It's actually surprisingly simple. 
It's not easy, but it's simple. 
It's not even new. 
It may be one of our most ancient human heritages. 
The secret to peace is us. 
It's us who act as a surrounding community around any conflict, who can play a constructive role. 
Let me give you just a story, an example. 
About 20 years ago, I was in South Africa, working with the parties in that conflict, and I had an extra month, so I spent some time living with several groups of San Bushmen. 
I was curious about them, about the way in which they resolve conflict. 
Because, after all, within living memory, they were hunters and gatherers, living pretty much like our ancestors lived for maybe 99 percent of the human story. 
And all the men have these poison arrows that they use for hunting -- absolutely fatal. 
So how do they deal with their differences? 
Well, what I learned is, whenever tempers rise in those communities, someone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush, and then everyone sits around in a circle like this, and they sit and they talk and they talk. 
It may take two days, three days, four days, but they don't rest until they find a resolution or better yet -- a reconciliation. 
And if tempers are still too high, then they send someone off to visit some relatives, as a cooling-off period. 
Well, that system is, I think, probably the system that kept us alive to this point, given our human tendencies. 
That system, I call "the third side." 
Because if you think about it, normally when we think of conflict, when we describe it, there's always two sides -- it's Arabs versus Israelis, labor versus management, husband versus wife, Republicans versus Democrats. 
But what we don't often see is that there's always a third side, and the third side of the conflict is us, it's the surrounding community, it's the friends, the allies, the family members, the neighbors. 
And we can play an incredibly constructive role. 
Perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what's really at stake. 
For the sake of the kids, for the sake of the family, for the sake of the community, for the sake of the future, let's stop fighting for a moment and start talking. 
Because, the thing is, when we're involved in conflict, it's very easy to lose perspective. 
It's very easy to react. 
Human beings -- we're reaction machines. 
And as the saying goes, when angry, you will make the best speech you will ever regret. 
(Laughter) And so the third side reminds us of that. 
The third side helps us go to the balcony, which is a metaphor for a place of perspective, where we can keep our eyes on the prize. 
Let me tell you a little story from my own negotiating experience. 
Some years ago, I was involved as a facilitator in some very tough talks between the leaders of Russia and the leaders of Chechnya. 
There was a war going on, as you know. 
And we met in the Hague, in the Peace Palace, in the same room where the Yugoslav war-crimes tribunal was taking place. 
And the talks got off to a rather rocky start when the vice president of Chechnya began by pointing at the Russians and said, "You should stay right here in your seats, because you're going to be on trial for war crimes." 
And then he turned to me and said, "You're an American. 
Look at what you Americans are doing in Puerto Rico." 
And my mind started racing, "Puerto Rico? What do I know about Puerto Rico?" 
I started reacting. 
(Laughter) But then, I tried to remember to go to the balcony. 
And then when he paused and everyone looked at me for a response, from a balcony perspective, I was able to thank him for his remarks and say, "I appreciate your criticism of my country and I take it as a sign that we're among friends and can speak candidly to one another." 
(Laughter) "And what we're here to do is not to talk about Puerto Rico or the past. 
We're here to see if we can figure out a way to stop the suffering and the bloodshed in Chechnya." 
The conversation got back on track. 
That's the role of the third side, to help the parties go to the balcony. 
Now let me take you, for a moment, to what's widely regarded as the world's most difficult conflict, or the most impossible conflict, the Middle East. 
Question is: where's the third side there? 
How could we possibly go to the balcony? 
Now, I don't pretend to have an answer to the Middle East conflict, but I think I've got a first step -- literally, a first step -- something that any one of us could do as third-siders. 
Let me just ask you one question first. 
How many of you in the last years have ever found yourself worrying about the Middle East and wondering what anyone could do? 
Just out of curiosity, how many of you? 
OK, so the great majority of us. 
And here, it's so far away. 
Why do we pay so much attention to this conflict? 
Is it the number of deaths? 
There are a hundred times more people who die in a conflict in Africa than in the Middle East. 
No, it's because of the story, because we feel personally involved in that story. 
Whether we're Christians, Muslims or Jews, religious or non-religious, we feel we have a personal stake in it. 
Stories matter; as an anthropologist, I know that. 
Stories are what we use to transmit knowledge. 
They give meaning to our lives. 
That's what we tell here at TED, we tell stories. 
Stories are the key. 
And so my question is -- yes, let's try and resolve the politics there in the Middle East, but let's also take a look at the story. 
Let's try to get at the root of what it's all about. 
Let's see if we can apply the third side to it. 
What would that mean? What is the story there? 
Now, as anthropologists, we know that every culture has an origin story. 
What's the origin story of the Middle East? 
In a phrase, it's: Four thousand years ago, a man and his family walked across the Middle East, and the world has never been the same since. 
That man, of course, was Abraham. 
And what he stood for was unity, the unity of the family; he's the father of us all. 
But it's not just what he stood for, it's what his message was. 
His basic message was unity too, the interconnectedness of it all, the unity of it all. 
And his basic value was respect, was kindness toward strangers. 
That's what he's known for, his hospitality. 
So in that sense, he's the symbolic third side of the Middle East. 
He's the one who reminds us that we're all part of a greater whole. 
Now, think about that for a moment. 
Today, we face the scourge of terrorism. 
What is terrorism? 
Terrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger and treating them as an enemy whom you kill in order to create fear. 
What's the opposite of terrorism? 
It's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home, in order to sow and create understanding or respect, or love. 
So what if, then, you took the story of Abraham, which is a third-side story, what if that could be -- because Abraham stands for hospitality -- what if that could be an antidote to terrorism? 
What if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance? 
How would you bring that story to life? 
Now, it's not enough just to tell a story. 
That's powerful, but people need to experience the story. 
They need to be able to live the story. 
How would you do that? 
And that was my thinking of how would you do that. 
And that's what comes to the first step here. 
Because the simple way to do that is: you go for a walk. 
You go for a walk in the footsteps of Abraham. 
You retrace the footsteps of Abraham. 
Because walking has a real power. 
You know, as an anthropologist, walking is what made us human. 
It's funny -- when you walk, you walk side-by-side, in the same common direction. 
Now if I were to come to you face-to-face and come this close to you, you would feel threatened. 
But if I walk shoulder-to-shoulder, even touching shoulders, it's no problem. 
Who fights while they walk? 
That's why in negotiations, often, when things get tough, people go for walks in the woods. 
So the idea came to me of, what about inspiring a path, a route -- think the Silk Route, think the Appalachian Trail -- that followed in the footsteps of Abraham? 
People said, "That's crazy. You can't. 
You can't retrace the footsteps of Abraham -- it's too insecure, you've got to cross all these borders, it goes across 10 different countries in the Middle East, because it unites them all." 
And so we studied the idea at Harvard. 
And then a few years ago, a group of us, about 25 of us from 10 different countries, decided to see if we could retrace the footsteps of Abraham, going from his initial birthplace in the city of Urfa in Southern Turkey, Northern Mesopotamia. 
And we then took a bus and took some walks and went to Harran, where, in the Bible, he sets off on his journey. 
Then we crossed the border into Syria, went to Aleppo, which, turns out, is named after Abraham. 
We went to Damascus, which has a long history associated with Abraham. 
We then came to Northern Jordan, to Jerusalem -- which is all about Abraham -- to Bethlehem, and finally, to the place where he's buried, in Hebron. 
So effectively, we went from womb to tomb. 
We showed it could be done. 
It was an amazing journey. 
Let me ask you a question. 
How many of you have had the experience of being in a strange neighborhood or strange land, and a total stranger, perfect stranger, comes up to you and shows you some kindness -- maybe invites you into their home, gives you a drink, gives you a coffee, gives you a meal? 
How many of you have ever had that experience? 
That's the essence of the Abraham Path. 
That's what you discover as you go into these villages in the Middle East where you expect hostility, and you get the most amazing hospitality, all associated with Abraham: "In the name of Father Ibrahim, let me offer you some food." 
So what we discovered is that Abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people; he's alive, he's a living presence. 
And to make a long story short, in the last couple of years now, thousands of people have begun to walk parts of the path of Abraham in the Middle East, enjoying the hospitality of the people there. 
They've begun to walk in Israel and Palestine, in Jordan, in Turkey, in Syria. 
It's an amazing experience. 
Men, women, young people, old people -- more women than men, actually, interestingly. 
For those who can't walk, who are unable to get there right now, people started to organize walks in cities, in their own communities. 
In Cincinnati, for instance, they organized a walk from a church to a mosque to a synagogue and all had an Abrahamic meal together. 
It was Abraham Path Day. 
In São Paulo, Brazil, it's become an annual event for thousands of people to run in a virtual Abraham Path Run, uniting the different communities. 
The media love it; they really adore it. 
They lavish attention on it because it's visual and it spreads the idea, this idea of Abrahamic hospitality, of kindness towards strangers. 
And just a couple weeks ago, there was an NPR story on it. 
Last month, there was a piece in the Manchester Guardian about it, two whole pages. 
And they quoted a villager who said, "This walk connects us to the world." 
He said, "It was like a light that went on in our lives -- it brought us hope." 
And so that's what it's about. 
But it's not just about psychology; it's about economics. 
Because as people walk, they spend money. 
And this woman right here, Um Ahmad, is a woman who lives on the path in Northern Jordan. 
She's desperately poor. 
She's partially blind, her husband can't work, she's got seven kids. 
But what she can do is cook. 
And so she's begun to cook for some groups of walkers who come through the village and have a meal in her home. 
They sit on the floor -- she doesn't even have a tablecloth. 
She makes the most delicious food, that's fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside. 
And so more and more walkers have come, and lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family. 
And so she told our team there, she said, "You have made me visible in a village where people were once ashamed to look at me." 
That's the potential of the Abraham Path. 
There are literally hundreds of those kinds of communities across the Middle East, across the path. 
The potential is basically to change the game. 
And to change the game, you have to change the frame, the way we see things -- to change the frame from hostility to hospitality, from terrorism to tourism. 
And in that sense, the Abraham Path is a game-changer. 
I have a little acorn here that I picked up while I was walking on the path earlier this year. 
Now, the acorn is associated with the oak tree, of course -- grows into an oak tree, which is associated with Abraham. 
The path right now is like an acorn; it's still in its early phase. 
What would the oak tree look like? 
When I think back to my childhood, a good part of which I spent, after being born here in Chicago, I spent in Europe. 
If you had been in the ruins of, say, London in 1945, or Berlin, and you had said, "Sixty years from now, this is going to be the most peaceful, prosperous part of the planet," people would have thought you were certifiably insane. 
But they did it, thanks to a common identity, Europe, and a common economy. 
So my question is, if it can be done in Europe, why not in the Middle East? 
Why not, thanks to a common identity, which is the story of Abraham, and thanks to a common economy that would be based, in good part, on tourism? 
So let me conclude, then, by saying that in the last 35 years, as I've worked in some of the most dangerous, difficult and intractable conflicts around the planet, I have yet to see one conflict that I felt could not be transformed. 
It's not easy, of course. 
But it's possible. 
It was done in South Africa. 
It was done in Northern Ireland. 
It could be done anywhere. 
It simply depends on us. 
It depends on us taking the third side. 
So let me invite you to consider taking the third side, even as a very small step. 
We're about to take a break in a moment. 
Just go up to someone who's from a different culture, a different country, a different ethnicity -- some difference -- and engage them in a conversation. 
That's a third-side act. 
That's walking Abraham's Path. 
After a TED Talk, why not a TED Walk? 
(Laughter) So let me just leave you with three things. 
One is, the secret to peace is the third side. 
The third side is us. 
Each of us, with a single step, can take the world, can bring the world a step closer to peace. 
There's an old African proverb that goes: "When spiderwebs unite, they can halt even the lion." 
If we're able to unite our third-side webs of peace, we can even halt the lion of war. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

Okay, I'm going to show you again something about our diets. 
And I would like to know what the audience is, and so who of you ever ate insects? 
That's quite a lot. 
(Laughter) But still, you're not representing the overall population of the Earth. 
(Laughter) Because there's 80 percent out there that really eats insects. 
But this is quite good. 
Why not eat insects? Well first, what are insects? 
Insects are animals that walk around on six legs. 
And here you see just a selection. 
There's six million species of insects on this planet, six million species. 
There's a few hundreds of mammals -- six million species of insects. 
In fact, if we count all the individual organisms, we would come at much larger numbers. 
In fact, of all animals on Earth, of all animal species, 80 percent walks on six legs. 
But if we would count all the individuals, and we take an average weight of them, it would amount to something like 200 to 2,000 kilograms for each of you and me on Earth. 
That means that in terms of biomass, insects are more abundant than we are, and we're not on a planet of men, but we're on a planet of insects. 
Insects are not only there in nature, but they also are involved in our economy, usually without us knowing. 
There was an estimation, a conservative estimation, a couple of years ago that the U.S. economy benefited by 57 billion dollars per year. 
It's a number -- very large -- a contribution to the economy of the United States for free. 
And so I looked up what the economy was paying for the war in Iraq in the same year. 
It was 80 billion U.S. dollars. 
Well we know that that was not a cheap war. 
So insects, just for free, contribute to the economy of the United States with about the same order of magnitude, just for free, without everyone knowing. 
And not only in the States, but in any country, in any economy. 
What do they do? 
They remove dung, they pollinate our crops. 
A third of all the fruits that we eat are all a result of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants. 
They control pests, and they're food for animals. 
They're at the start of food chains. 
Small animals eat insects. 
Even larger animals eat insects. 
But the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals, still larger animals. 
And at the end of the food chain, we are eating them as well. 
There's quite a lot of people that are eating insects. 
And here you see me in a small, provincial town in China, Lijiang -- about two million inhabitants. 
If you go out for dinner, like in a fish restaurant, where you can select which fish you want to eat, you can select which insects you would like to eat. 
And they prepare it in a wonderful way. 
And here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars, locusts, bee pupae -- delicacies. 
And you can eat something new everyday. 
There's more than 1,000 species of insects that are being eaten all around the globe. 
That's quite a bit more than just a few mammals that we're eating, like a cow or a pig or a sheep. 
More than 1,000 species -- an enormous variety. 
And now you may think, okay, in this provincial town in China they're doing that, but not us. 
Well we've seen already that quite some of you already ate insects maybe occasionally, but I can tell you that every one of you is eating insects, without any exception. 
You're eating at least 500 grams per year. 
What are you eating? 
Tomato soup, peanut butter, chocolate, noodles -- any processed food that you're eating contains insects, because insects are here all around us, and when they're out there in nature they're also in our crops. 
Some fruits get some insect damage. 
Those are the fruits, if they're tomato, that go to the tomato soup. 
If they don't have any damage, they go to the grocery. 
And that's your view of a tomato. 
But there's tomatoes that end up in a soup, and as long as they meet the requirements of the food agency, there can be all kinds of things in there, no problem. 
In fact, why would we put these balls in the soup, there's meat in there anyway? 
(Laughter) In fact, all our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of. 
So anything is a good protein source already. 
Now you may say, "Okay, so we're eating 500 grams just by accident." 
We're even doing this on purpose. 
In a lot of food items that we have -- I have only two items here on the slide -- pink cookies or surimi sticks or, if you like, Campari -- a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a natural dye. 
The surimi sticks [of] crabmeat, or is being sold as crab meat, is white fish that's being dyed with cochineal. 
Cochineal is a product of an insect that lives off these cacti. 
It's being produced in large amounts, 150 to 180 metric tons per year in the Canary Islands in Peru, and it's big business. 
One gram of cochineal costs about 30 euros. 
One gram of gold is 30 euros. 
So it's a very precious thing that we're using to dye our foods. 
Now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me, for everyone on this Earth. 
The human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially. 
Where, at the moment, we have something between six and seven billion people, it will grow to about nine billion in 2050. 
That means that we have a lot more mouths to feed, and this is something that worries more and more people. 
There was an FAO conference last October that was completely devoted to this. 
How are we going to feed this world? 
And if you look at the figures up there, it says that we have a third more mouths to feed, but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent. 
And that's especially because this world population is increasing, and it's increasing, not only in numbers, but we're also getting wealthier, and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more and also starts to eat more meat. 
And meat, in fact, is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production. 
Our diet consists, [in] some part, of animal proteins, and at the moment, most of us here get it from livestock, from fish, from game. 
And we eat quite a lot of it. 
In the developed world it's on average 80 kilograms per person per year, which goes up to 120 in the United States and a bit lower in some other countries, but on average 80 kilograms per person per year. 
In the developing world it's much lower. 
It's 25 kilograms per person per year. 
But it's increasing enormously. 
In China in the last 20 years, it increased from 20 to 50, and it's still increasing. 
So if a third of the world population is going to increase its meat consumption from 25 to 80 on average, and a third of the world population is living in China and in India, we're having an enormous demand on meat. 
And of course, we are not there to say that's only for us, it's not for them. 
They have the same share that we have. 
Now to start with, I should say that we are eating way too much meat in the Western world. 
We could do with much, much less -- and I know, I've been a vegetarian for a long time, and you can easily do without anything. 
You'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway. 
But then there's a lot of problems that come with meat production, and we're being faced with that more and more often. 
The first problem that we're facing is human health. 
Pigs are quite like us. 
They're even models in medicine, and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human. 
That means that pigs also share diseases with us. 
And a pig disease, a pig virus, and a human virus can both proliferate, and because of their kind of reproduction, they can combine and produce a new virus. 
This has happened in the Netherlands in the 1990s during the classical swine fever outbreak. 
You get a new disease that can be deadly. 
We eat insects -- they're so distantly related from us that this doesn't happen. 
So that's one point for insects. 
(Laughter) And there's the conversion factor. 
You take 10 kilograms of feed, you can get one kilogram of beef, but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat. 
So if you would be an entrepreneur, what would you do? 
With 10 kilograms of input, you can get either one or nine kg. of output. 
So far we're taking the one, or up to five kilograms of output. 
We're not taking the bonus yet. 
We're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet. 
So that's two points for insects. 
(Laughter) And there's the environment. 
If we take 10 kilograms of food -- (Laughter) and it results in one kilogram of beef, the other nine kilograms are waste, and a lot of that is manure. 
If you produce insects, you have less manure per kilogram of meat that you produce. 
So less waste. 
Furthermore, per kilogram of manure, you have much, much less ammonia and fewer greenhouse gases when you have insect manure than when you have cow manure. 
So you have less waste, and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung. 
So that's three points for insects. 
(Laughter) Now there's a big "if," of course, and it is if insects produce meat that is of good quality. 
Well there have been all kinds of analyses and in terms of protein, or fat, or vitamins, it's very good. 
In fact, it's comparable to anything we eat as meat at the moment. 
And even in terms of calories, it is very good. 
One kilogram of grasshoppers has the same amount of calories as 10 hot dogs, or six Big Macs. 
So that's four points for insects. 
(Laughter) I can go on, and I could make many more points for insects, but time doesn't allow this. 
So the question is, why not eat insects? 
I gave you at least four arguments in favor. 
We'll have to. 
Even if you don't like it, you'll have to get used to this because at the moment, 70 percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock. 
That's not only the land where the livestock is walking and feeding, but it's also other areas where the feed is being produced and being transported. 
We can increase it a bit at the expense of rainforests, but there's a limitation very soon. 
And if you remember that we need to increase agricultural production by 70 percent, we're not going to make it that way. 
We could much better change from meat, from beef, to insects. 
And then 80 percent of the world already eats insects, so we are just a minority -- in a country like the U.K., the USA, the Netherlands, anywhere. 
On the left-hand side, you see a market in Laos where they have abundantly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night. 
On the right-hand side you see a grasshopper. 
So people there are eating them, not because they're hungry, but because they think it's a delicacy. 
It's just very good food. 
You can vary enormously. 
It has many benefits. 
In fact, we have delicacy that's very much like this grasshopper: shrimps, a delicacy being sold at a high price. 
Who wouldn't like to eat a shrimp? 
There are a few people who don't like shrimp, but shrimp, or crabs, or crayfish, are very closely related. 
They are delicacies. 
In fact, a locust is a "shrimp" of the land, and it would make very good into our diet. 
So why are we not eating insects yet? 
Well that's just a matter of mindset. 
We're not used to it, and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us. 
That's why we're changing the perception of insects. 
And I'm working very hard with my colleague, Arnold van Huis, in telling people what insects are, what magnificent things they are, what magnificent jobs they do in nature. 
And in fact, without insects, we would not be here in this room, because if the insects die out, we will soon die out as well. 
If we die out, the insects will continue very happily. 
(Laughter) So we have to get used to the idea of eating insects. 
And some might think, well they're not yet available. 
Well they are. 
There are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them, and one of them is here in the audience, Marian Peeters, who's in the picture. 
I predict that later this year, you'll get them in the supermarkets -- not visible, but as animal protein in the food. 
And maybe by 2020, you'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat. 
And they're being made in the most wonderful ways. 
A Dutch chocolate maker. 
(Music) (Applause) So there's even a lot of design to it. 
(Laughter) Well in the Netherlands, we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture, and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry. 
And when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U. 
over to the Hague recently, she went to a high-class restaurant, and they ate insects all together. 
It's not something that is a hobby of mine. 
It's really taken off the ground. 
So why not eat insects? 
You should try it yourself. 
A couple of years ago, we had 1,750 people all together in a square in Wageningen town, and they ate insects at the same moment, and this was still big, big news. 
I think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects, because it's just a normal way of doing. 
So you can try it yourself today, and I would say, enjoy. 
And I'm going to show to Bruno some first tries, and he can have the first bite. 
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Look at them first. Look at them first. 
Marcel Dicke: It's all protein. 
BG: That's exactly the same [one] you saw in the video actually. 
And it looks delicious. 
They just make it [with] nuts or something. 
MD: Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I'm here today to share with you an extraordinary journey - extraordinarily rewarding journey, actually - which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis. 
As a child, I had two passions. 
One was a passion for rodents. 
I had all kinds of rats, mice, hamsters, gerbils, squirrels. 
You name it, I bred it, and I sold them to pet shops. 
(Laughter) I also had a passion for Africa. 
Growing up in a multicultural environment, we had African students in the house, and I learned about their stories, so different backgrounds, dependency on imported know-how, goods, services, exuberant cultural diversity. 
Africa was truly fascinating for me. 
I became an industrial engineer, engineer in product development, and I focused on appropriate detection technologies, actually the first appropriate technologies for developing countries. 
I started working in the industry, but I wasn't really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear, extracting and manufacturing mode. 
I quit my job to focus on the real world problem: landmines. 
We're talking '95 now. 
Princess Diana is announcing on TV that landmines form a structural barrier to any development, which is really true. 
As long as these devices are there, or there is suspicion of landmines, you can't really enter into the land. 
Actually, there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable in the environments where they're needed to produce, which is mainly in the developing world. 
We chose rats. 
Why would you choose rats? 
Because, aren't they vermin? 
Well, actually rats are, in contrary to what most people think about them, rats are highly sociable creatures. 
And actually, our product -- what you see here. 
There's a target somewhere here. 
You see an operator, a trained African with his rats in front who actually are left and right. 
There, the animal finds a mine. 
It scratches on the soil. 
And the animal comes back for a food reward. 
Very, very simple. 
Very sustainable in this environment. 
Here, the animal gets its food reward. 
And that's how it works. 
Very, very simple. 
Now why would you use rats? 
Rats have been used since the '50s last century, in all kinds of experiments. 
Rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species. 
They're extremely sensitive to smell. 
Moreover, they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it. 
Now how do we communicate with rats? 
Well don't talk rat, but we have a clicker, a standard method for animal training, which you see there. 
A clicker, which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors. 
First of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward, which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe. 
Once the animal knows click, food, click, food, click, food -- so click is food -- we bring it in a cage with a hole, and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed, and to do that for five seconds -- five seconds, which is long for a rat. 
Once the animal knows this, we make the task a bit more difficult. 
It learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes, up to 10 holes. 
Then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets. 
In the next step, animals learn to find real mines in real minefields. 
They are tested and accredited according to International Mine Action Standards, just like dogs have to pass a test. 
This consists of 400 square meters. 
There's a number of mines placed blindly, and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets. 
If the animal does that, it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field -- just like dogs, by the way. 
Maybe one slight difference: we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog. 
This is our team in Mozambique: one Tanzanian trainer, who transfers the skills to these three Mozambican fellows. 
And you should see the pride in the eyes of these people. 
They have a skill, which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid. 
Moreover, this small team together with, of course, you need the heavy vehicles and the manual de-miners to follow-up. 
But with this small investment in a rat capacity, we have demonstrated in Mozambique that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter up to 60 percent of what is currently normal -- two dollars per square meter, we do it at $1.18, and we can still bring that price down. 
Question of scale. 
If you can bring in more rats, we can actually make the output even bigger. 
We have a demonstration site in Mozambique. 
Eleven African governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology. 
They have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the Great Lakes region, and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines. 
But let me bring you to a very different problem. 
And there's about 6,000 people last year that walked on a landmine, but worldwide last year, almost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis as a first cause of infection. 
Especially in Africa where T.B. and HIV are strongly linked, there is a huge common problem. 
Microscopy, the standard WHO procedure, reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability. 
In Tanzania -- the numbers don't lie -- 45 percent of people -- T.B. patients -- get diagnosed with T.B. before they die. 
It means that, if you have T.B., you have more chance that you won't be detected, but will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on. 
And if, however, you are detected very early, diagnosed early, treatment can start, and even in HIV-positives, it makes sense. 
You can actually cure T.B., even in HIV-positives. 
So in our common language, Dutch, the name for T.B. 
is "tering," which, etymologically, refers to the smell of tar. 
Already the old Chinese and the Greek, Hippocrates, have actually published, documented, that T.B. can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients. 
So what we did is we collected some samples -- just as a way of testing -- from hospitals, trained rats on them and see if this works, and wonder, well, we can reach 89 percent sensitivity, 86 percent specificity using multiple rats in a row. 
This is how it works, and really, this is a generic technology. 
We're talking now explosives, tuberculosis, but can you imagine, you can actually put anything under there. 
So how does it work? 
You have a cassette with 10 samples. 
You put these 10 samples at once in the cage. 
An animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent, so it goes extremely fast. 
Here it's already at the third sample. 
This is a positive sample. 
It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward. 
And by doing so, very fast, we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive, which are negative. 
Just as an indication, whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day, a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only. 
A cage like this -- (Applause) A cage like this -- provided that you have rats, and we have now currently 25 tuberculosis rats -- a cage like this, operating throughout the day, can process 1,680 samples. 
Can you imagine the potential offspring applications -- environmental detection of pollutants in soils, customs applications, detection of illicit goods in containers and so on. 
But let's stick first to tuberculosis. 
I just want to briefly highlight, the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam on a population of 500,000 people, where 15,000 reported to get a test done. 
Microscopy for 1,800 patients. 
And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back, we were able to increase case detection rates by over 30 percent. 
Throughout last year, we've been -- depending on which intervals you take -- we've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam between 30 and 40 percent. 
So this is really considerable. 
Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to 15 people, healthy people, per year, you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives. 
At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives. 
The way forward for us is now to standardize this technology. 
And there are simple things like, for instance, we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds. 
So, to standardize this. 
Also, to standardize the pellets, the food rewards, and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people. 
To conclude, there are also other applications at the horizon. 
Here is a first prototype of our camera rat, which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on. 
This is in a prototype stage. 
We don't have a working system here yet. 
To conclude, I would actually like to say, you may think this is about rats, these projects, but in the end it is about people. 
It is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult, expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks, and doing that with a local resource, plenty available. 
So something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you, whether they are environmental, technological, animal, or human. 
And to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable world. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

A few years ago, I found myself looking for the most cost-effective way to be stylish. 
So naturally, I wound up at my local thrift store, a wonderland of other people's trash that was ripe to be plucked to become my treasure. 
Now, I wasn't just looking for your average off-the-secondhand-rack vintage T-shirt to wear. 
For me, real style lives at the intersection of design and individuality. 
So to make sure that I was getting the most out of the things I was finding, I bought a sewing machine so I could tailor the 90's-style garments that I was finding, to fit a more contemporary aesthetic. 
I've been tailoring and making my own clothes from scratch ever since, so everything in my closet is uniquely my own. 
But as I was sorting through the endless racks of clothes at these thrift stores, I started to ask myself, what happens to all the clothes that I don't buy? 
The stuff that isn't really cool or trendy but kind of just sits there and rots away at these secondhand stores. 
I work in the fashion industry on the wholesale side, and I started to see some of the products that we sell end up on the racks of these thrift stores. 
So the question started to work its way into my work life, as well. 
I did some research and I pretty quickly found a very scary supply chain that led me to some pretty troubling realities. 
It turned out that the clothes I was sorting though at these thrift stores represented only a small fraction of the total amount of garments that we dispose of each year. 
In the US, only 15 percent of the total textile and garment waste that's generated each year ends up being donated or recycled in some way, which means that the other 85 percent of textile and garment waste end up in landfills every year. 
Now, I want to put this into perspective, because I don't quite think that the 85 percent does the problem justice. 
This means that almost 13 million tons of clothing and textile waste end up in landfills every year in just the United States alone. 
This averages out to be roughly 200 T-shirts per person ending up in the garbage. 
In Canada, we throw away enough clothing to fill the largest stadium in my home town of Toronto, one that seats 60,000 people, with a mountain of clothes three times the size of that stadium. 
Now, even with this, I still think that Canadians are the more polite North Americans, so don't hold it against us. 
(Laughter) What was even more surprising was seeing that the fashion industry is the second-largest polluter in the world behind the oil and gas industry. 
This is an important comparison to make. 
I don't want to defend the oil and gas industry but I'd be lying if I said I was surprised to hear they were the number one polluter. 
I just assumed, fairly or not, that that's an industry that doesn't really mind sticking to the status quo. 
One where the technology doesn't really change and the focus is more so on driving profitability at the expense of a sustainable future. 
But I was really surprised to see that the fashion industry was number two. 
Because maintaining that status quo is the opposite of what the fashion industry stands for. 
The unfortunate reality is, not only do we waste a lot of the things we do consume, but we also use a lot to produce the clothes that we buy each year. 
On average, a household's purchase of clothing per year requires 1,000 bathtubs of water to produce. 
A thousand bathtubs of water per household, per year. 
That's a lot of water. 
It seems that the industry that always has been and probably always will be on the forefront of design, creates products that are designed to be comfortable, designed to be trendy and designed to be expressive but aren't really designed to be sustainable or recyclable for that matter. 
But I think that can change. 
I think the fashion industry's aptitude for change is the exact thing that should make it patient zero for sustainable business practices. 
And I think to get started, all we have to do is start to design clothes to be recyclable at the end of their life. 
Now, designing recyclable clothing is definitely something to leave to the professionals. 
But as a 24-year-old thrift store aficionado armed with a sewing machine, if I were to very humbly posit one perspective, it would be to approach clothing design kind of like building with Lego. 
When we put together a brick of Lego, it's very strong but very easily manipulated. 
It's modular in its nature. 
Clothing design as it stands today is very rarely modular. 
Take this motorcycle jacket as an example. 
It's a pretty standard jacket with its buttons, zippers and trim. 
But in order for us to efficiently recycle a jacket like this, we need to be able to easily remove these items and quickly get down to just the fabric. 
Once we have just the fabric, we're able to break it down by shredding it and getting back to thread level, make new thread that then gets made into new fabric and ultimately new clothing, whether it be a new jacket or new T-shirts, for example. 
But the complexity lies with all of these extra items, the buttons, the zippers and the trim. 
Because in reality, these items are actually quite difficult to remove. 
So in many cases it requires more time or more money to disassemble a jacket like this. 
In some cases, it's just more cost-effective to throw it away rather than recycle it. 
But I think this can change if we design clothes in a modular way to be easily disassembled at the end of their lives. 
We could redesign this jacket to have a hidden wireframe, kind of like the skeleton of a fish, that holds all important items together. 
This invisible fish-bone structure can have all of these extra items, the zippers and the buttons and the trim, sewn into it and then attached to the fabric. 
So at the end of the jacket's life, all you have to do is remove its fish bone and the fabric comes with it a lot quicker and a lot easier than before. 
Now, recycling clothing is definitely one piece of the puzzle. 
But if we want to take fixing the environmental impact that the fashion industry has more seriously, then we need to take this to the next step and start to design clothes to also be compostable at the end of their lives. 
For most of the types of clothes we have in our closet the average lifespan is about three years. 
Now, I'm sure there's many of us that have gems in our drawers that are much older than that, which is great. 
Because being able to extend the life of a garment by even only nine months reduces the waste and water impact that that garment has by 20 to 30 percent. 
But fashion is fashion. 
Which means that styles are always going to change and you're probably going to be wearing something different than you were today eight seasons from now, no matter how environmentally friendly you want to be. 
But lucky for us, there are some items that never go out of style. 
I'm talking about your basics -- your socks, underwear, even your pajamas. 
We're all guilty of wearing these items right down to the bone, and in many cases throwing them in the garbage because it's really difficult to donate your old ratty socks that have holes in them to your local thrift store. 
But what if we were able to compost these items rather than throw them in the trash bin? 
The environmental savings could be huge, and all we would have to do is start to shift more of our resources to start to produce more of these items using more natural fibers, like 100 percent organic cotton. 
Now, recycling and composting are two critical priorities. 
But one other thing that we have to rethink is the way that we dye our clothes. 
Currently, 10 to 20 percent of the harsh chemical dye that we use end up in water bodies that neighbor production hubs in developing nations. 
The tricky thing is that these harsh chemicals are really effective at keeping a garment a specific color for a long period of time. 
It's these harsh chemicals that keep that bright red dress bright red for so many years. 
But what if we were able to use something different? 
What if we were able to use something that we all have in our kitchen cabinets at home to dye our clothes? 
What if we were able to use spices and herbs to dye our clothes? 
There's countless food options that would allow for us to stain material, but these stains change color over time. 
This would be pretty different than the clothes that were dyed harshly with chemicals that we're used to. 
But dyeing clothes naturally this way would allow for us to make sure they're more unique and environmentally friendlier. 
Let's think about it. 
Fashion today is all about individuality. 
It's about managing your own personal appearance to be just unique enough to be cool. 
These days, everybody has the ability to showcase their brand their personal style, across the world, through social media. 
The pocket-sized billboards that we flick through on our Instagram feeds are chock-full of models and taste-makers that are showcasing their individuality through their personal microbrands. 
But what could be more personalized, more unique, than clothes that change color over time? 
Clothes that with each wash and with each wear become more and more one of a kind. 
People have been buying and wearing ripped jeans for years. 
So this would just be another example of clothes that exist in our wardrobe that evolve with us over our lives. 
This shirt, for example, is one that, much to the dismay of my mother and the state of her kitchen, I dyed at home, using turmeric, before coming here today. 
This shirt is something that none of my friends are going to have on their Instagram feed. 
So it's unique, but more importantly, it's naturally dyed. 
Now, I'm not suggesting that everybody dye their clothes in their kitchen sink at home. 
But if we were able to apply this or a similar process on a commercial scale, then our need to rely on these harsh chemical dyes for our clothes could be easily reduced. 
The 2.4-trillion-dollar fashion industry is fiercely competitive. 
So the business that can provide a product at scale while also promising its customers that each and every garment will become more unique over time will have a serious competitive advantage. 
Brands have been playing with customization for years. 
The rise of e-commerce services, like Indochino, a bespoke suiting platform, and Tinker Tailor, a bespoke dress-making platform, have made customization possible from your couch. 
Nike and Adidas have been mastering their online shoe customization platforms for years. 
Providing individuality at scale is a challenge that most consumer-facing businesses encounter. 
So being able to tackle this while also providing an environmentally friendly product could lead to a pretty seismic industry shift. 
And at that point, it's not just about doing what's best for our environment but also what's best for the bottom line. 
There's no fix-all, and there's no one-step solution. 
But we can get started by designing clothes with their death in mind. 
The fashion industry is the perfect industry to experiment with and embrace change that can one day get us to the sustainable future we so desperately need. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So I'm going to speak about a problem that I have and that's that I'm a philosopher. 
(Laughter) When I go to a party and people ask me what do I do and I say, "I'm a professor," their eyes glaze over. 
When I go to an academic cocktail party and there are all the professors around, they ask me what field I'm in and I say, "philosophy" -- their eyes glaze over. 
(Laughter) When I go to a philosopher's party (Laughter) and they ask me what I work on and I say, "consciousness," their eyes don't glaze over -- their lips curl into a snarl. 
(Laughter) And I get hoots of derision and cackles and growls because they think, "That's impossible! You can't explain consciousness." 
The very chutzpah of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question. 
My late, lamented friend Bob Nozick, a fine philosopher, in one of his books, "Philosophical Explanations," is commenting on the ethos of philosophy -- the way philosophers go about their business. 
And he says, you know, "Philosophers love rational argument." 
And he says, "It seems as if the ideal argument for most philosophers is you give your audience the premises and then you give them the inferences and the conclusion, and if they don't accept the conclusion, they die. 
Their heads explode." The idea is to have an argument that is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents. 
But in fact that doesn't change people's minds at all. 
It's very hard to change people's minds about something like consciousness, and I finally figured out the reason for that. 
The reason for that is that everybody's an expert on consciousness. 
We heard the other day that everybody's got a strong opinion about video games. 
They all have an idea for a video game, even if they're not experts. 
But they don't consider themselves experts on video games; they've just got strong opinions. 
I'm sure that people here who work on, say, climate change and global warming, or on the future of the Internet, encounter people who have very strong opinions about what's going to happen next. 
But they probably don't think of these opinions as expertise. 
They're just strongly held opinions. 
But with regard to consciousness, people seem to think, each of us seems to think, "I am an expert. 
Simply by being conscious, I know all about this." 
And so, you tell them your theory and they say, "No, no, that's not the way consciousness is! 
No, you've got it all wrong." 
And they say this with an amazing confidence. 
And so what I'm going to try to do today is to shake your confidence. Because I know the feeling -- I can feel it myself. 
I want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds -- that you are, yourselves, authoritative about your own consciousness. 
That's the order of the day here. 
Now, this nice picture shows a thought-balloon, a thought-bubble. 
I think everybody understands what that means. 
That's supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness. 
This is my favorite picture of consciousness that's ever been done. 
It's a Saul Steinberg of course -- it was a New Yorker cover. 
And this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque. 
That reminds him of the word baroque, barrack, bark, poodle, Suzanne R. -- he's off to the races. 
There's a wonderful stream of consciousness here and if you follow it along, you learn a lot about this man. 
What I particularly like about this picture, too, is that Steinberg has rendered the guy in this sort of pointillist style. 
Which reminds us, as Rod Brooks was saying yesterday: what we are, what each of us is -- what you are, what I am -- is approximately 100 trillion little cellular robots. 
That's what we're made of. 
No other ingredients at all. We're just made of cells, about 100 trillion of them. 
Not a single one of those cells is conscious; not a single one of those cells knows who you are, or cares. 
Somehow, we have to explain how when you put together teams, armies, battalions of hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells -- not so different really from a bacterium, each one of them -- the result is this. I mean, just look at it. 
The content -- there's color, there's ideas, there's memories, there's history. And somehow all that content of consciousness is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons. 
How is that possible? Many people just think it isn't possible at all. 
They think, "No, there can't be any sort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness." 
This is a lovely book by a friend of mine named Lee Siegel, who's a professor of religion, actually, at the University of Hawaii, and he's an expert magician, and an expert on the street magic of India, which is what this book is about, "Net of Magic." 
And there's a passage in it which I would love to share with you. 
It speaks so eloquently to the problem. 
"'I'm writing a book on magic,' I explain, and I'm asked, 'Real magic?' By 'real magic,' people mean miracles, thaumaturgical acts, and supernatural powers. 
'No,' I answer. 'Conjuring tricks, not real magic.' 'Real magic,' in other words, refers to the magic that is not real; while the magic that is real, that can actually be done, is not real magic." 
(Laughter) Now, that's the way a lot of people feel about consciousness. 
(Laughter) Real consciousness is not a bag of tricks. 
If you're going to explain this as a bag of tricks, then it's not real consciousness, whatever it is. 
And, as Marvin said, and as other people have said, "Consciousness is a bag of tricks." 
This means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied and incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness. 
So this is the problem. So I have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won't like, for the same reason that you don't like to see a magic trick explained to you. 
How many of you here, if somebody -- some smart aleck -- starts telling you how a particular magic trick is done, you sort of want to block your ears and say, "No, no, I don't want to know! 
Don't take the thrill of it away. I'd rather be mystified. 
Don't tell me the answer." 
A lot of people feel that way about consciousness, I've discovered. 
And I'm sorry if I impose some clarity, some understanding on you. 
You'd better leave now if you don't want to know some of these tricks. 
But I'm not going to explain it all to you. 
I'm going to do what philosophers do. 
Here's how a philosopher explains the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick. 
You know the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick? 
The philosopher says, "I'm going to explain to you how that's done. 
You see, the magician doesn't really saw the lady in half." 
(Laughter) "He merely makes you think that he does." 
And you say, "Yes, and how does he do that?" 
He says, "Oh, that's not my department, I'm sorry." 
(Laughter) So now I'm going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness. 
But I'm going to try to also show you that consciousness isn't quite as marvelous -- your own consciousness isn't quite as wonderful -- as you may have thought it is. 
This is something, by the way, that Lee Siegel talks about in his book. 
He marvels at how he'll do a magic show, and afterwards people will swear they saw him do X, Y, and Z. He never did those things. 
He didn't even try to do those things. 
People's memories inflate what they think they saw. 
And the same is true of consciousness. 
Now, let's see if this will work. All right. Let's just watch this. 
Watch it carefully. 
I'm working with a young computer-animator documentarian named Nick Deamer, and this is a little demo that he's done for me, part of a larger project some of you may be interested in. 
We're looking for a backer. 
It's a feature-length documentary on consciousness. 
OK, now, you all saw what changed, right? 
How many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color? 
Every one. I'll just show you by running it again. 
Even when you know that they're all going to change color, it's very hard to notice. You have to really concentrate to pick up any of the changes at all. 
Now, this is an example -- one of many -- of a phenomenon that's now being studied quite a bit. 
It's one that I predicted in the last page or two of my 1991 book, "Consciousness Explained," where I said if you did experiments of this sort, you'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes. 
If there's time at the end, I'll show you the much more dramatic case. 
Now, how can it be that there are all those changes going on, and that we're not aware of them? 
Well, earlier today, Jeff Hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades, the way your eye moves around three or four times a second. 
He didn't mention the speed. Your eye is constantly in motion, moving around, looking at eyes, noses, elbows, looking at interesting things in the world. 
And where your eye isn't looking, you're remarkably impoverished in your vision. 
That's because the foveal part of your eye, which is the high-resolution part, is only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length. 
That's the detail part. 
It doesn't seem that way, does it? 
It doesn't seem that way, but that's the way it is. 
You're getting in a lot less information than you think. 
Here's a completely different effect. This is a painting by Bellotto. 
It's in the museum in North Carolina. 
Bellotto was a student of Canaletto's. 
And I love paintings like that -- the painting is actually about as big as it is right here. 
And I love Canalettos, because Canaletto has this fantastic detail, and you can get right up and see all the details on the painting. 
And I started across the hall in North Carolina, because I thought it was probably a Canaletto, and would have all that in detail. 
And I noticed that on the bridge there, there's a lot of people -- you can just barely see them walking across the bridge. 
And I thought as I got closer I would be able to see all the detail of most people, see their clothes, and so forth. 
And as I got closer and closer, I actually screamed. 
I yelled out because when I got closer, I found the detail wasn't there at all. 
There were just little artfully placed blobs of paint. 
And as I walked towards the picture, I was expecting detail that wasn't there. 
The artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothes and wagons and all sorts of things, and my brain had taken the suggestion. 
You're familiar with a more recent technology, which is -- There, you can get a better view of the blobs. 
See, when you get close they're really just blobs of paint. 
You will have seen something like this -- this is the reverse effect. 
I'll just give that to you one more time. 
Now, what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion? 
When an artful blob of paint or two, by an artist, suggests a person -- say, one of Marvin Minsky's little society of mind -- do they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere? 
I don't think so. Not a chance. But then, how on Earth is it done? 
Well, remember the philosopher's explanation of the lady? 
It's the same thing. 
The brain just makes you think that it's got the detail there. 
You think the detail's there, but it isn't there. 
The brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all. 
It's just making you expect the detail. 
Let's just do this experiment very quickly. 
Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right, rotated? 
Yes. 
How many of you did it by rotating the one on the left in your mind's eye, to see if it matched up with the one on the right? 
How many of you rotated the one on the right? OK. 
How do you know that's what you did? 
(Laughter) There's in fact been a very interesting debate raging for over 20 years in cognitive science -- various experiments started by Roger Shepherd, who measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images. 
Yes, it's possible to do that. 
But the details of the process are still in significant controversy. 
And if you read that literature, one of the things that you really have to come to terms with is even when you're the subject in the experiment, you don't know. 
You don't know how you do it. 
You just know that you have certain beliefs. 
And they come in a certain order, at a certain time. 
And what explains the fact that that's what you think? 
Well, that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician. 
This is a figure that I love: Bradley, Petrie, and Dumais. 
You may think that I've cheated, that I've put a little whiter-than-white boundary there. 
How many of you see that sort of boundary, with the Necker cube floating in front of the circles? 
Can you see it? 
Well, you know, in effect, the boundary's really there, in a certain sense. 
Your brain is actually computing that boundary, the boundary that goes right there. 
But now, notice there are two ways of seeing the cube, right? 
It's a Necker cube. 
Everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube? OK. 
Can you see the four ways of seeing the cube? 
Because there's another way of seeing it. 
If you're seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles, some black circles, there's another way of seeing it. 
As a cube, on a black background, as seen through a piece of Swiss cheese. 
(Laughter) Can you get it? How many of you can't get it? That'll help. 
(Laughter) Now you can get it. These are two very different phenomena. 
When you see the cube one way, behind the screen, those boundaries go away. 
But there's still a sort of filling in, as we can tell if we look at this. 
We don't have any trouble seeing the cube, but where does the color change? 
Does your brain have to send little painters in there? 
The purple-painters and the green-painters fight over who's going to paint that bit behind the curtain? No. 
Your brain just lets it go. The brain doesn't need to fill that in. 
When I first started talking about the Bradley, Petrie, Dumais example that you just saw -- I'll go back to it, this one -- I said that there was no filling-in behind there. 
And I supposed that that was just a flat truth, always true. 
But Rob Van Lier has recently shown that it isn't. 
Now, if you think you see some pale yellow -- I'll run this a few more times. 
Look in the gray areas, and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there -- yeah, it's amazing. There's nothing there. It's no trick. 
["Failure to Detect Changes in Scenes" slide] This is Ron Rensink's work, which was in some degree inspired by that suggestion right at the end of the book. 
Let me just pause this for a second if I can. 
This is change-blindness. 
What you're going to see is two pictures, one of which is slightly different from the other. 
You see here the red roof and the gray roof, and in between them there will be a mask, which is just a blank screen, for about a quarter of a second. 
So you'll see the first picture, then a mask, then the second picture, then a mask. 
And this will just continue, and your job as the subject is to press the button when you see the change. 
So, show the original picture for 240 milliseconds. Blank. 
Show the next picture for 240 milliseconds. Blank. 
And keep going, until the subject presses the button, saying, "I see the change." 
So now we're going to be subjects in the experiment. 
We're going to start easy. Some examples. 
No trouble there. 
Can everybody see? All right. 
Indeed, Rensink's subjects took only a little bit more than a second to press the button. 
Can you see that one? 
2.9 seconds. 
How many don't see it still? 
What's on the roof of that barn? 
(Laughter) It's easy. 
Is it a bridge or a dock? 
There are a few more really dramatic ones, and then I'll close. 
I want you to see a few that are particularly striking. 
This one because it's so large and yet it's pretty hard to see. 
Can you see it? 
Audience: Yes. 
Dan Dennett: See the shadows going back and forth? Pretty big. 
So 15.5 seconds is the median time for subjects in his experiment there. 
I love this one. I'll end with this one, just because it's such an obvious and important thing. 
How many still don't see it? How many still don't see it? 
How many engines on the wing of that Boeing? 
(Laughter) Right in the middle of the picture! 
Thanks very much for your attention. 
What I wanted to show you is that scientists, using their from-the-outside, third-person methods, can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dream of, and that, in fact, you're not the authority on your own consciousness that you think you are. 
And we're really making a lot of progress on coming up with a theory of mind. 
Jeff Hawkins, this morning, was describing his attempt to get theory, and a good, big theory, into the neuroscience. 
And he's right. This is a problem. 
Harvard Medical School once -- I was at a talk -- director of the lab said, "In our lab, we have a saying. 
If you work on one neuron, that's neuroscience. 
If you work on two neurons, that's psychology." 
(Laughter) We have to have more theory, and it can come as much from the top down. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

Restaurants and the food industry in general are pretty much the most wasteful industry in the world. 
For every calorie of food that we consume here in Britain today, 10 calories are taken to produce it. 
That's a lot. 
I want to take something rather humble to discuss. 
I found this in the farmers' market today, and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later, you're very welcome to. 
The humble potato -- and I've spent a long time, 25 years, preparing these. 
And it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime. 
First of all, it's planted, and that takes energy. 
It grows and is nurtured. 
It's then harvested. 
It's then distributed, and distribution is a massive issue. 
It's then sold and bought, and it's then delivered to me. 
I basically take it, prepare it, and then people consume it -- hopefully they enjoy it. 
The last stage is basically waste, and this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it. 
There are different types of waste. 
There's a waste of time; there's a waste of space; there's a waste of energy; and there's a waste of waste. 
And every business I've been working on over the past five years, I'm trying to lower each one of these elements. 
Okay, so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like. 
Basically a restaurant just like any other. 
This is the restaurant, Acorn House. 
Front and back. 
So let me run you through a few ideas. 
Floor: sustainable, recyclable. 
Chairs: recycled and recyclable. 
Tables: Forestry Commission. 
This is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood. 
This bench, although it was uncomfortable for my mom -- she didn't like sitting on it, so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale -- reusing, a job that was pretty good. 
I hate waste, especially walls. 
If they're not working, put a shelf on it, which I did, and that shows all the customers my products. 
The whole business is run on sustainable energy. 
This is powered by wind. All of the lights are daylight bulbs. 
Paint is all low-volume chemical, which is very important when you're working in the room all the time. 
I was experimenting with these -- I don't know if you can see it -- but there's a work surface there. 
And that's a plastic polymer. 
And I was thinking, well I'm trying to think nature, nature, nature. 
But I thought, no, no, experiment with resins, experiment with polymers. 
Will they outlive me? They probably might. 
Right, here's a reconditioned coffee machine. 
It actually looks better than a brand new one -- so looking good there. 
Now reusing is vital. 
And we filter our own water. 
We put them in bottles, refrigerate them, and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again. 
Here's a great little example. 
If you can see this orange tree, it's actually growing in a car tire, which has been turned inside out and sewn up. 
It's got my compost in it, which is growing an orange tree, which is great. 
This is the kitchen, which is in the same room. 
I basically created a menu that allowed people to choose the amount and volume of food that they wanted to consume. 
Rather than me putting a dish down, they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted. 
Okay, it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters. 
It serves 220 people a day. 
We generate quite a lot of waste. 
This is the waste room. 
You can't get rid of waste. 
But this story's not about eliminating it, it's about minimizing it. 
In here, I have produce and boxes that are unavoidable. 
I put my food waste into this dehydrating, desiccating macerator -- turns food into an inner material, which I can store and then compost later. 
I compost it in this garden. 
All of the soil you can see there is basically my food, which is generated by the restaurant, and it's growing in these tubs, which I made out of storm-felled trees and wine casks and all kinds of things. 
Three compost bins -- go through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week -- really good, makes fantastic compost. 
A couple of wormeries in there too. 
And actually one of the wormeries was a big wormery. I had a lot of worms in it. 
And I tried taking the dried food waste, putting it to the worms, going, "There you go, dinner." 
It was like vegetable jerky, and killed all of them. 
I don't know how many worms [were] in there, but I've got some heavy karma coming, I tell you. 
(Laughter) What you're seeing here is a water filtration system. 
This takes the water out of the restaurant, runs it through these stone beds -- this is going to be mint in there -- and I sort of water the garden with it. 
And I ultimately want to recycle that, put it back into the loos, maybe wash hands with it, I don't know. 
So, water is a very important aspect. 
I started meditating on that and created a restaurant called Waterhouse. 
If I could get Waterhouse to be a no-carbon restaurant that is consuming no gas to start with, that would be great. 
I managed to do it. 
This restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House -- same chairs, same tables. 
They're all English and a little bit more sustainable. 
But this is an electrical restaurant. 
The whole thing is electric, the restaurant and the kitchen. 
And it's run on hydroelectricity, so I've gone from air to water. 
Now it's important to understand that this room is cooled by water, heated by water, filters its own water, and it's powered by water. 
It literally is Waterhouse. 
The air handling system inside it -- I got rid of air-conditioning because I thought there was too much consumption going on there. 
This is basically air-handling. 
I'm taking the temperature of the canal outside, pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism, it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof, and that, in turn, is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant, cooling them, or heating them, as the need may be. 
And this is an English willow air diffuser, and that's softly moving that air current through the room. 
Very advanced, no air-conditioning -- I love it. 
In the canal, which is just outside the restaurant, there is hundreds of meters of coil piping. 
This takes the temperature of the canal and turns it into this four-degrees of heat exchange. 
I have no idea how it works, but I paid a lot of money for it. 
(Laughter) And what's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant lives on this boat -- it's off-grid; it generates all its own power. 
He's growing all his own fruit, and that's fantastic. 
There's no accident in names of these restaurants. 
Acorn House is the element of wood; Waterhouse is the element of water; and I'm thinking, well, I'm going to be making five restaurants based on the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities. 
I've got water and wood. I'm just about to do fire. 
I've got metal and earth to come. 
So you've got to watch your space for that. 
Okay. So this is my next project. 
Five weeks old, it's my baby, and it's hurting real bad. 
The People's Supermarket. 
So basically, the restaurants only really hit people who believed in what I was doing anyway. 
What I needed to do was get food out to a broader spectrum of people. 
So people -- i.e., perhaps, more working-class -- or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative. 
This is a social enterprise, not-for-profit cooperative supermarket. 
It really is about the social disconnect between food, communities in urban settings and their relationship to rural growers -- connecting communities in London to rural growers. 
Really important. 
So I'm committing to potatoes; I'm committing to milk; I'm committing to leeks and broccoli -- all very important stuff. 
I've kept the tiles; I've kept the floors; I've kept the trunking; I've got in some recycled fridges; I've got some recycled tills; I've got some recycled trolleys. 
I mean, the whole thing is is super-sustainable. 
In fact, I'm trying and I'm going to make this the most sustainable supermarket in the world. 
That's zero food waste. 
And no one's doing that just yet. 
In fact, Sainsbury's, if you're watching, let's have a go. Try it on. 
I'm going to get there before you. 
So nature doesn't create waste doesn't create waste as such. 
Everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle with waste being the end of the beginning, and that's been something that's been nurturing me for some time, and it's an important statement to understand. 
If we don't stand up and make a difference and think about sustainable food, think about the sustainable nature of it, then we may fail. 
But, I wanted to get up and show you that we can do it if we're more responsible. 
Environmentally conscious businesses are doable. 
They're here. You can see I've done three so far; I've got a few more to go. 
The idea is embryonic. 
I think it's important. 
I think that if we reduce, reuse, refuse and recycle -- right at the end there -- recycling is the last point I want to make; but it's the four R's, rather than the three R's -- then I think we're going to be on our way. 
So these three are not perfect -- they're ideas. 
I think that there are many problems to come, but with help, I'm sure I'm going to find solutions. 
And I hope you all take part. 
Thank you very much. (Applause) 

I'm Chris Nowinski, and odds are if you've met me in the last five years I've asked you, after a few minutes, a bit of an odd question: Can I have your brain? 
Now, it only seems like a strange question if you don't know my story so please let me share it with you. 
I grew up outside of Chicago, and I was an athlete and I was very lucky to get recruited to play football at Harvard University. 
So that's me. 
And then after graduating, like most Harvard graduates, I decided I wanted to join the WWE. 
So that's also me. 
(Laughter) Sure you remember me from Monday Night Raw in 2002 and 2003, and I had a blast playing what people affectionately like to call Chris Harvard, the Ivy League snob. 
(Laughter) It was perfect for me. 
But unfortunately, I got kicked in the head by my colleague Bubba Ray Dudley, and I suffered a severe concussion. 
And it led to what became permanent postconcussion symptoms: constant headaches, inability to sleep, depression, feeling in a fog. 
And in that first year, I tried to figure out how could I make this pain go away. 
And I wasn't getting the answers I needed from doctors, and so I started digging into the medical literature. 
And I found there's this whole story about concussions that we weren't really being told. 
So I decided to write a book about it, called "Head Games: Football's Concussion Crisis" that came out in 2006. 
But in that process, I learned it's not really just about concussions. 
I learned about a disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE. 
What we used to call punch-drunk, because we only knew about it from boxers. 
We knew that getting hit in the head too many times with boxers would cause their brain to essentially start to rot, to degenerate. 
And they'd have symptoms like memory problems and problems with cognition, depression, impulse control issues, aggression. 
So basically, I got ... 
I got injured at the right time, in which the first two NFL players were studied for this disease. 
And it turned out they both had it. 
The first was Mike Webster, 50 years old, already had dementia. 
The second, Terry Long, 45 years old when he took his life. 
The medical examiner in Pittsburgh decided to look at their brains and found this disease. 
I wrote a chapter about it, and I thought people would make a big deal out of it. 
But shockingly, even when the first two cases came in positive, there was never a national news story about this, what's going on in football with these cases of CTE. 
So the book comes out, not a whole lot is happening, and one day I read the newspaper -- November 20, 2006. 
I find out that Andre Waters just took his life. 
Those of you who know football, Andre Waters was someone I grew up watching. 
Former Philadelphia Eagles strong safety, [44] years old, a Division II football coach when he decided to put a gun to his head. 
In the article they reminded me, his nickname was Dirty Waters. 
He was known for leading with his head, so I thought I'm just going to look up did he ever talk about the concussions he had. 
And I found a quote from 1994 where Andre Waters said, "I stopped counting my concussions at 15. 
I wouldn't say anything, I'd just sniff smelling salts and go back out there." 
And I thought, I wonder if he might have CTE, too. 
If that might have contributed to whatever made him choose to end his life. 
So I ended up calling the doctor who did the first two studies, and I said, "Hey, I think you should study Andre Waters." 
And he said, "I'd be happy to. 
The problem is, the first two cases died in the county in which I work, and I could study them as part of my job. 
I can't do that with Andre Waters, he died in Florida. 
If you want me to study him, you're going to have to figure out how to get me the brain." 
So I said, "OK. 
How does one get a brain?" 
(Laughter) So I racked my brain and I thought, why don't I call the medical examiner who I think has the brain right now? 
So I called up the medical examiner in Florida, and I said, "Hey, you don't know me, but do you still have the brain of Andre Waters?" 
(Laughter) And he said, "Yes, I do." 
I said, "OK, are you going to study him for CTE?" 
And he said no, in fact at that time he didn't believe that was a real disease. 
I said, "OK, if you're not, do you mind if I have it?" 
And he said, "Well, young man, I can't give you the brain. 
You need his family's permission. 
But if you do get the permission of his next of kin, I will release the brain to you." 
And I said, "Great!" 
And then I realized I had to figure out who his next of kin was and ask them, and it turned out it was Andre Waters's 88-year-old mother. 
And I sat there, and I took a breath and I thought, "Am I really going to cold-call an 88-year-old grieving mother who just lost her son to suicide?" 
And almost everything in me said, "Don't do it. 
It's too much to put this poor woman through, she's been through so much already." 
But then this other voice in my head said, "You know what? 
If guys are killing themselves from this disease and we could study it to maybe prevent this from happening in the future, sometimes you've just got to suck it up and do something that's very hard." 
So I called her. 
First time, nobody answered. 
Second time, no one answered, third... no voice mails. 
The fifth time, I got an answer. 
And thank God that Andre Waters's family was so gracious about the call and said, "You know what, we want to know what happened to Andre. 
We want to know why he changed so much in the last five years of his life." 
And so we studied the brain, and it turned out that he did have CTE. 
He became the third NFL player diagnosed with the disease. 
This is what it looks like. 
He was somewhere between mild and severe. 
OK, we have three of three NFL players here. 
Maybe this needs to get a little bit more serious. 
Maybe something's happening here. 
So I ended up starting the Concussion Legacy Foundation, actually formalized the work, so it wasn't just some guy calling for brains. 
And I searched the world. 
And I put together the best research team I could find. 
So we partnered with Boston University, we partnered with scientists at the VA here in Boston, and we started a brain bank. 
Turns out, if you want to know how to cure degenerative brain disease, you have to start by actually studying the brains. 
At this point, we were the first center in the world focused on CTE. 
It just had not been studied formally. 
And so we start this brain bank, and it's my job to get the brains for Dr. Ann McKee and her brain bank, right in the middle. 
We also work with Dr. Bob Stern, Dr. Robert Cantu, truly my dream team of scientists that I support. 
So my job is to get the brains. 
And I was very successful in those early years. 
Since 2007 I've started every day by reading the obituaries. 
And it's a tough way to live. 
And it's hard on me and it's even worse on these poor families that I've been calling for the last 10 years, to ask for their brains. 
And so early on in the process, as it started to really eat away at me, I decided, you know what, can I find another way to get people to donate their brains to this research? 
And I figured out, what if we could create a culture of brain donation in this country? 
What if it became normal for athletes to donate their brain after they died? 
And so what I started was a brain donation registry. 
And I started asking athletes if they would publicly pledge to donate their brain to science. 
And it started with, actually, a hockey player in 2009. 
One of my first pledges was a former Harvard hockey player, Noah Welch, who was in the NHL at the time. 
It was a slow start people understanding what this was about. 
So when the news hit the front page, "Noah Welch pledging his brain to science," he said he went to the locker room the next day, one of his teammates pulled him aside and said, "Hey, I heard you're donating your brain to science." 
And he said, "Yep." 
And he said, "Wow. How many games are you going to miss?" 
(Laughter) True story. 
(Laughter) But we've been remarkably successful -- over 2,500 athletes have signed up. 
They get a brain-donation card they keep in their wallet. 
This is mine, I was obviously first, it says 01. 
And I will donate my brain to this. 
We've also been lucky to have people like Brandi Chastain, the women's soccer icon, NASCAR's Dale Earnhardt Jr. 
Just two weeks ago, Hall-of-Famer Nick Buoniconti who had been diagnosed with dementia, signed up to pledge his brain. 
So it's been wonderful, and the great thing about it is that it has worked in changing how we're able to get brains. 
So now, instead of me having to call, more families call us. 
And our phones ring off the hook. 
And so I can now focus on taking this information, figuring out how do we work towards a cure, how do we work towards prevention, and so my life has gotten a lot easier. 
This is just some of the headlines that we've able to get over the years from athletes pledging their brain. 
The problem has been what we learned. 
So when we started this, only 45 cases existed in the world of this disease that had been studied in brain banks. 
Since then, we have acquired 500 brains and found over 300 of them had CTE. 
To put that in perspective, the rest of the world has not studied 100 brains since we started this. 
What we've seen though is very frightening. 
So some of you might have seen the headline in July in the "New York Times." 
And a recent study we published, that of the first 111 NFL players we looked at 110 were positive for this disease. 
Of the first 53 college football players we looked at, 48 had this disease. 
That's something that's a very big concern to me. 
And so now, I'm very much focused on what can we do to actually treat this disease? 
We still can't diagnose CTE in living people, we have no treatments that are going to be coming out of the pharmaceutical industry in the next five years. 
This is a long, long fight. 
But our Concussion Legacy Foundation is here to not only facilitate this work, and that's the long game, but the short game is, hey, we can prevent this. 
We can prevent this disease if we just stopped hitting people in the head so much. 
And frankly, we need to stop hitting children in the head. 
Turns out, it's not a great idea to hit a five-year-old in the head 500 times each year. 
And it does actually open up the door to this disease. 
And so, we've got a lot of work ahead of us. 
But I have great hope that we're on our way to curing this disease. 
But I hope you understand my story a little more now. 
And now that we've gotten to know each other a little bit better, this is the time where I ask you, "Can I have your brain?" 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I'm not quite sure whether I really want to see a snare drum at nine o'clock or so in the morning. 
(Laughter) But anyway, it's just great to see such a full theater, and really, I must thank Herbie Hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation. 
(Applause) One of the interesting things, of course, is the combination of that raw hand on the instrument and technology, and what he said about listening to our young people. 
Of course, my job is all about listening. 
And my aim, really, is to teach the world to listen. 
That's my only real aim in life. 
And it sounds quite simple, but actually, it's quite a big, big job. 
Because you know, when you look at a piece of music, for example, if I just open my little motorbike bag -- we have here, hopefully, a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page. 
And, you know, we open it up ... 
So technically, I can actually read this. 
I will follow the instructions, the tempo markings, the dynamics. 
I will do exactly as I'm told. 
And so therefore, because time is short, if I just played you, literally, the first, maybe, two lines or so -- It's very straightforward; there's nothing too difficult about the piece. 
But here, I'm being told that the piece of music is very quick. 
I'm being told where to play on the drum. 
I'm being told which part of the stick to use. 
And I'm being told the dynamic. 
And I'm also being told that the drum is without snares. 
Snares on, snares off. 
So therefore, if I translate this piece of music, we have this idea. 
(Drum sounds) (Drum sounds end) And so on. 
My career would probably last about five years. 
(Laughter) However, what I have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music; everything that there isn't time to learn from a teacher, or to talk about, even, from a teacher. 
But it's the things you notice when you're not actually with your instrument that, in fact, become so interesting, and that you want to explore through this tiny, tiny surface of a drum. 
So there, we experience the translation. 
(Drum sounds) (Drum sounds end) (Applause) Now my career may last a little longer. 
(Laughter) But in a way, you know, it's the same if I look at you and I see a nice, bright young lady with a pink top on. 
I see that you're clutching a teddy bear, etc., etc. 
So I get a basic idea as to what you might be about, what you might like, what you might do as a profession, etc., etc. 
However, that's just the initial idea I may have that we all get when we actually look and we try to interpret. 
But actually it's so unbelievably shallow. 
In the same way, I look at the music; I get a basic idea; I wonder what technically might be hard, or, you know, what I want to do. 
Just the basic feeling. 
However, that is simply not enough. 
And I think what Herbie said: please listen, listen. 
We have to listen to ourselves, first of all. 
If I play, for example, holding the stick -- where literally I do not let go of the stick -- (Drum sound) you'll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm. 
And you feel really quite -- believe it or not -- detached from the instrument and from the stick, even though I'm actually holding the stick quite tightly. 
(Drum sound) By holding it tightly, I feel strangely more detached. 
If I just simply let go and allow my hand, my arm, to be more of a support system, suddenly -- (Drum sound) I have more dynamic with less effort. 
Much more -- (Drum sound) and I just feel, at last, one with the stick and one with the drum. 
And I'm doing far, far less. 
So in the same way that I need time with this instrument, I need time with people in order to interpret them. 
Not just translate them, but interpret them. 
If, for example, I play just a few bars of a piece of music for which I think of myself as a technician -- that is, someone who is basically a percussion player -- (Marimba sounds) (Marimba sounds end) And so on, if I think of myself as a musician -- (Marimba sounds) (Marimba sounds end) And so on. 
There is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just -- (Applause) thinking about. 
And I remember when I was 12 years old, and I started playing timpani and percussion, and my teacher said, "Well, how are we going to do this? You know, music is about listening." 
And I said, "Yes, I agree with that, so what's the problem?" 
And he said, "Well, how are you going to hear this? 
And I said, "Well, how do you hear it?" 
He said, "Well, I think I hear it through here." 
And I said, "Well, I think I do too, but I also hear it through my hands, through my arms, cheekbones, my scalp, my tummy, my chest, my legs and so on." 
And so we began our lessons every single time tuning drums, in particular, the kettle drums, or timpani to such a narrow pitch interval, so something like -- (Marimba sounds) that of a difference. 
Then gradually: (Marimba sounds) And gradually: (Marimba sounds) And it's amazing that when you do open your body up, and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through, that in fact the tiny, tiny difference -- (Marimba sounds) can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger, there. 
And so what we would do is that I would put my hands on the wall of the music room, and together, we would "listen" to the sounds of the instruments, and really try to connect with those sounds far, far more broadly than simply depending on the ear. 
Because of course, the ear is subject to all sorts of things. 
The room we happen to be in, the amplification, the quality of the instrument, the type of sticks -- (Marimba sounds) (Marimba sounds end) Etc., etc., they're all different. 
(Marimba sounds) (Marimba sounds end) Same amount of weight, but different sound colors. 
And that's basically what we are; we're just human beings, but we all have our own little sound colors, as it were, that make up these extraordinary personalities and characters and interests and things. 
And as I grew older, I then auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music in London, and they said, "Well, no, we won't accept you, because we haven't a clue, you know, of the future of a so-called 'deaf musician.'" And I just couldn't quite accept that. 
And so therefore, I said to them, "Well, look, if you refuse -- if you refuse me through those reasons, as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound -- then we have to think very, very hard about the people you do actually accept." 
And as a result, once we got over a little hurdle, and having to audition twice, they accepted me. 
And not only that, what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the United Kingdom. 
Under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone had no arms, no legs -- they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand. 
No circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry. 
And every single entry had to be listened to, experienced, and then, based on the musical ability, then that person could either enter or not. 
And so therefore, this in turn meant that there was an extremely interesting bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions, and I have to say, many of them now in the professional orchestras throughout the world. 
The interesting thing about this as well, though -- (Applause) is quite simply that not only were people connected with sound -- which is basically all of us -- we well know that music really is our daily medicine. 
I say "music," but actually I mean "sound." 
Because some of the extraordinary things I've experienced as a musician -- when you may have a 15-year-old lad who has got the most incredible challenges, who may not be able to control his movements, who may be deaf, who may be blind, etc., etc. -- suddenly, if that young lad sits close to this instrument, and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba, and you play something that's so incredibly organ-like, almost -- I don't really have the right sticks, perhaps -- but something like this -- let me change -- (Soft marimba sounds) (Soft marimba sounds end) Something that's so unbelievably simple -- but he would be experiencing something that I wouldn't be, because I'm on top of the sound. 
I have the sound coming this way. 
He would have the sound coming through the resonators. 
If there were no resonators on here, we would have: (Marimba sounds) So he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rows wouldn't experience, those of you in the back few rows wouldn't experience, either. 
Every single one of us, depending on where we're sitting, will experience this sound quite, quite differently. 
And of course, being the participator of the sound, and that is, starting from the idea of what type of sound I want to produce, for example, this sound: (No sound) Can you hear anything? 
Exactly -- because I'm not even touching it. 
(Laughter) But yet, we get the sensation of something happening. 
In the same way that when I see a tree moves, then I imagine that tree making a rustling sound. 
Do you see what I mean? 
Whatever the eye sees, then there's always sound happening. 
So there's always, always that huge -- I mean, just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from. 
So all of my performances are based on entirely what I experience, and not by learning a piece of music, putting on someone else's interpretation of it, buying all the CDs possible of that particular piece of music, and so on and so forth, because that isn't giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic, and something that I can fully experience the journey of. 
So it may be that, in certain halls, this dynamic may well work. 
(Soft marimba sounds) (Soft marimba sounds end) It may be that in other halls, they're simply not going to experience that at all, and so therefore, my level of soft, gentle playing may have to be -- (Marimba sounds) (Marimba sounds end) Do you see what I mean? 
So, because of this explosion in access to sound, especially through the Deaf community, this has not only affected how music institutions, how schools for the deaf treat sound, and not just as a means of therapy -- although, of course, being a participator of music, that definitely is the case as well -- but it's meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together. 
There are so few halls in this world that actually have very good acoustics, dare I say. 
But by that I mean, where you can absolutely do anything you imagine. 
The tiniest, softest, softest sound to something that is so broad, so huge, so incredible. 
There's always something: it may sound good up there, may not be so good there; it may be great there, but terrible up there; maybe terrible over there, but not too bad there, etc., etc. 
So to find an actual hall is incredible -- for which you can play exactly what you imagine, without it being cosmetically enhanced. 
So therefore, acousticians are actually in conversation with people who are hearing impaired, and who are participators of sound. 
And this is quite interesting. 
I cannot give you any detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls, but it's just the fact that they are going to a group of people for whom so many years, we've been saying, "Well, how on earth can they experience music? They're deaf." 
We go like that, and we imagine that's what deafness is about. 
Or we go like that, and we imagine that's what blindness is about. 
If we see someone in a wheelchair, we assume they cannot walk. 
It may be that they can walk three, four, five steps. 
That, to them, means they can walk. 
In a year's time, it could be two extra steps. 
In another year's time, three extra steps. 
Those are hugely important aspects to think about. 
So when we do listen to each other, it's unbelievably important for us to really test our listening skills, to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber, to stop the judgment. 
For me, as a musician who deals with 99 percent of new music, it's very easy for me to say, "Oh yes, I like that piece. No, I don't like that piece," and so on. 
And I just find that I have to give those pieces of music real time. 
It may be that the chemistry isn't quite right between myself and that particular piece of music, but that doesn't mean I have the right to say it's a bad piece of music. 
And you know, one of the great things about being a musician is that it is so unbelievably fluid. 
So there are no rules, no right, no wrong, this way, that way. 
If I asked you to clap -- maybe I can do this. 
If I can just say, "Please clap and create the sound of thunder." 
I'm assuming we've all experienced thunder. 
Now, I don't mean just the sound; I mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves. 
And please try to create that through your clapping. 
Try, just -- please try. 
(Loud clapping sounds) (Clapping ends) Snow. 
(Laughter) Snow. 
(Soft clapping sounds) Have you ever heard snow? 
Audience: No. 
(Laughter) Try again. Try again: snow. 
(No sound) See, you're awake. 
Rain. 
(Light clapping sounds) EG: (Laughs) Not bad. Not bad. 
The interesting thing here, though, is that I asked a group of kids not so long ago exactly the same question. 
Now -- great imagination, thank you very much. 
However, not one of you got out of your seats to think, "Right! How can I clap? 
OK, maybe: (Clapping sounds) Maybe I can use my jewelry to create extra sounds. 
Maybe I can use the other parts of my body to create extra sounds." 
Not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands. 
In the same way, when we listen to music, we assume that it's all being fed through here. 
This is how we experience music. 
Of course, it's not. 
We experience thunder, thunder, thunder. 
Think, think, think. 
Listen, listen, listen. 
Now, what can we do with thunder? 
I remember my teacher, when I first started, my very first lesson, I was all prepared with sticks, ready to go. 
And instead of him saying, "OK, Evelyn, please, feet slightly apart, arms at a more or less 90-degree angle, sticks in a more or less V shape, keep this amount of space here, etc. 
Please keep your back straight, etc., etc., etc." -- where I was just probably going to end up absolutely rigid, frozen, and I would not be able to strike the drum because I was thinking of so many other things, he said, "Evelyn, take this drum away for seven days, and I'll see you next week." 
So -- heavens! What was I to do? 
I no longer required the sticks. 
I wasn't allowed to have these sticks. 
I had to basically look at this particular drum, see how it was made, what these little lugs did, what the snares did. 
Turned it upside down, experimented with the shell. 
(Drum sounds) Experimented with my body. 
Experimented with all sorts of things. 
(Drum sounds) (Drum sounds end) And of course, I returned with all sorts of bruises. 
(Laughter) But nevertheless, it was such an unbelievable experience, because where on earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music? 
Where on earth are you going to experience that in a study book? 
So we never, ever dealt with actual study books. 
So for example, one of the things that we learn when we are dealing with being a percussion player as opposed to a musician, is basically, straightforward single-stroke rolls. 
(Drum sounds) Like that, and then we get a little faster -- (Drum sounds) and a little faster -- (Drum sounds) and a little faster, and so on and so forth. 
What does this piece require? 
Single-stroke rolls. 
(Drum sound) So why can't I then do that whilst learning a piece of music? 
And that's exactly what he did. 
And interestingly, the older I became, and when I became a full-time student at a so-called "music institution," all of that went out of the window. 
We had to study from study books. 
And constantly, the question, "Well, why? Why? What is this relating to? 
I need to play a piece of music." 
"Well, how? Why do I need to learn that? 
I need to relate it to a piece of music. 
You know, I need to say something. 
Why am I practicing paradiddles? 
(Drum sounds) Is it just literally for control, for hand-stick control? 
Why am I doing that? 
I need to have the reason, and the reason has to be by saying something through the music." 
And by saying something through music, which basically is sound, we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people. 
But I don't want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage. 
That's up to you, when you walk through a hall, because that then determines what and how we listen to certain things. 
I may feel sorrowful, or happy, or exhilarated, or angry when I play certain pieces of music, but I'm not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing. 
So please, the next time you go to a concert, just allow your body to open up, allow your body to be this resonating chamber. 
Be aware that you're not going to experience the same thing as the performer is. 
The performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound, because they're hearing the contact of the stick -- (Drum sound) on the drum, or the mallet on the bit of wood, or the bow on the string, etc., or the breath that's creating the sound from wind and brass. 
They're experiencing that rawness there. 
But yet they're experiencing something so unbelievably pure, which is before the sound is actually happening. 
Please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike, or breath, is being pulled. 
Just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that I wished I'd experienced the whole journey of this particular conference, rather than just arriving last night. 
But I hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses. 
But thank you very much for having me! 
(Applause) (Applause ends) (Music) (Music ends) (Applause) 

It sure used to be a lot easier to be from Iceland, because until a couple of years ago, people knew hardly anything about us, and I could basically come out here and say only good things about us. 
But in the last couple of years we've become infamous for a couple of things. 
First, of course, the economic meltdown. 
It actually got so bad that somebody put our country up for sale on eBay. 
(Laughter) Ninety-nine pence was the starting price and no reserve. 
Then there was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of your friends, including President Obama. 
By the way, the pronunciation is "Eyjafjallajokull." 
None of your media got it right. 
(Laughter) But I'm not here to share these stories about these two things exactly. 
I'm here to tell you the story of Audur Capital, which is a financial firm founded by me and Kristin -- who you see in the picture -- in the spring of 2007, just over a year before the economic collapse hit. 
Why would two women who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking in the corporate sector leave to found a financial services firm? 
Well let it suffice to say that we felt a bit overwhelmed with testosterone. 
And I'm not here to say that men are to blame for the crisis and what happened in my country. 
But I can surely tell you that in my country, much like on Wall Street and the city of London and elsewhere, men were at the helm of the game of the financial sector, and that kind of lack of diversity and sameness leads to disastrous problems. 
(Applause) So we decided, a bit fed-up with this world and also with the strong feeling in our stomach that this wasn't sustainable, to found a financial services firm based on our values, and we decided to incorporate feminine values into the world of finance. 
Raised quite a few eyebrows in Iceland. 
We weren't known as the typical "women" women in Iceland up until then. 
So it was almost like coming out of the closet to actually talk about the fact that we were women and that we believed that we had a set of values and a way of doing business that would be more sustainable than what we had experienced until then. 
And we got a great group of people to join us -- principled people with great skills, and investors with a vision and values to match ours. 
And together we got through the eye of the financial storm in Iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients. 
And although I want to thank the talented people of our company foremost for that -- and also there's a factor of luck and timing -- we are absolutely convinced that we did this because of our values. 
So let me share with you our values. 
We believe in risk awareness. 
What does that mean? 
We believe that you should always understand the risks that you're taking, and we will not invest in things we don't understand. 
Not a complicated thing. 
But in 2007, at the height of the sub-prime and all the complicated financial structures, it was quite opposite to the reckless risk-taking behaviors that we saw on the market. 
We also believe in straight-talking, telling it as it is, using simple language that people understand, telling people about the downsides as well as the potential upsides, and even telling the bad news that no one wants to utter, like our lack of belief in the sustainability of the Icelandic financial sector that already we had months before the collapse hit us. 
And, although we do work in the financial sector, where Excel is king, we believe in emotional capital. 
And we believe that doing emotional due diligence is just as important as doing financial due diligence. 
It is actually people that make money and lose money, not Excel spreadsheets. 
(Applause) Last, but not least, we believe in profit with principles. 
We care how we make our profit. 
So while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers, we are willing to do it with a long-term view, and we like to have a wider definition of profits than just the economic profit in the next quarter. 
So we like to see profits, plus positive social and environmental benefits, when we invest. 
But it wasn't just about the values, although we are convinced that they matter. 
It was also about a business opportunity. 
It's the female trend, and it's the sustainability trend, that are going to create some of the most interesting investment opportunities in the years to come. 
The whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men; it is actually about women being different from men, bringing different values and different ways to the table. 
So what do you get? You get better decision-making, and you get less herd behavior, and both of those things hit your bottom line with very positive results. 
But one has to wonder, now that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in Iceland -- and by the way, Europe looks pretty bad right now, and many would say that you in America are heading for some more trouble as well. 
Now that we've had all that happen, and we have all this data out there telling us that it's much better to have diversity around the decision-making tables, will we see business and finance change? 
Will government change? 
Well I'll give you my straight talk about this. 
I have days that I believe, but I have days that I'm full of doubt. 
Have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us? 
(Applause) Einstein said that this was the definition of insanity -- to do the same things over and over again, hoping for a different outcome. 
So I guess the world is insane, because I see entirely too much of doing the same things over and over again, hoping that this time it's not going to collapse upon us. 
I want to see more revolutionary thinking, and I remain hopeful. 
Like TED, I believe in people. 
And I know that consumers are becoming more conscious, and they are going to start voting with their wallets, and they are going to change the face of business and finance from the outside, if they don't do it from the inside. 
But I'm more of the revolutionary, and I should be; I'm from Iceland. 
We have a long history of strong, courageous, independent women, ever since the Viking age. 
And I want to tell you when I first realized that women matter to the economy and to the society, I was seven -- it happened to be my mother's birthday -- October 24, 1975. 
Women in Iceland took the day off. 
From work or from home, they took the day off, and nothing worked in Iceland. 
(Laughter) They marched into the center of Reykjavik, and they put women's issues onto the agenda. 
And some say this was the start of a global movement. 
For me it was the start of a long journey, but I decided that day to matter. 
Five years later, Iceland elected Vigdis Finnbogadottir as their president -- first female to become head of state, single mom, a breast cancer survivor who had had one of her breasts removed. 
And at one of the campaign sessions, she had one of her male contenders allude to the fact that she couldn't become president -- she was a woman, and even half a woman. 
That night she won the election, because she came back -- not just because of his crappy behavior -- but she came back and said, "Well, I'm actually not going to breastfeed the Icelandic nation; I'm going to lead it." 
(Applause) So I've had incredibly many women role models that have influenced who I am and where I am today. 
But in spite of that, I went through the first 10 or 15 years of my career mostly in denial of being a woman. 
Started in corporate America, and I was absolutely convinced that it was just about the individual, that women and men would have just the same opportunities. 
But I've come to conclude lately that it isn't like that. 
We are not the same, and it's great. Because of our differences, we create and sustain life. 
So we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge. 
The final thought I want to leave with you is that I'm fed up with this tyranny of either/or choices in life -- either it's men or it's women. 
We need to start embracing the beauty of balance. 
So let's move away from thinking about business here and philanthropy there, and let's start thinking about doing good business. 
That's how we change the world. That's the only sustainable future. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I grew up in New York City, between Harlem and the Bronx. 
Growing up as a boy, we were taught that men had to be tough, had to be strong, had to be courageous, dominating -- no pain, no emotions, with the exception of anger -- and definitely no fear; that men are in charge, which means women are not; that men lead, and you should just follow and do what we say; that men are superior; women are inferior; that men are strong; women are weak; that women are of less value, property of men, and objects, particularly sexual objects. 
I've later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men, better known as the "man box." 
See this man box has in it all the ingredients of how we define what it means to be a man. 
Now I also want to say, without a doubt, there are some wonderful, wonderful, absolutely wonderful things about being a man. 
But at the same time, there's some stuff that's just straight up twisted, and we really need to begin to challenge, look at it and really get in the process of deconstructing, redefining, what we come to know as manhood. 
This is my two at home, Kendall and Jay. 
They're 11 and 12. 
Kendall's 15 months older than Jay. 
There was a period of time when my wife -- her name is Tammie -- and I, we just got real busy and whip, bam, boom: Kendall and Jay. 
(Laughter) And when they were about five and six, four and five, Jay could come to me, come to me crying. 
It didn't matter what she was crying about, she could get on my knee, she could snot my sleeve up, just cry, cry it out. 
Daddy's got you. That's all that's important. 
Now Kendall on the other hand -- and like I said, he's only 15 months older than her -- he'd come to me crying, it's like as soon as I would hear him cry, a clock would go off. 
I would give the boy probably about 30 seconds, which means, by the time he got to me, I was already saying things like, "Why are you crying? 
Hold your head up. Look at me. 
Explain to me what's wrong. 
Tell me what's wrong. I can't understand you. 
Why are you crying?" 
And out of my own frustration of my role and responsibility of building him up as a man to fit into these guidelines and these structures that are defining this man box, I would find myself saying things like, "Just go in your room. 
Just go on, go on in your room. 
Sit down, get yourself together and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a --" what? 
(Audience: Man.) Like a man. 
And he's five years old. 
And as I grow in life, I would say to myself, "My God, what's wrong with me? 
What am I doing? Why would I do this?" 
And I think back. 
I think back to my father. 
There was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family. 
My brother, Henry, he died tragically when we were teenagers. 
We lived in New York City, as I said. 
We lived in the Bronx at the time, and the burial was in a place called Long Island, it was about two hours outside of the city. 
And as we were preparing to come back from the burial, the cars stopped at the bathroom to let folks take care of themselves before the long ride back to the city. 
And the limousine empties out. 
My mother, my sister, my auntie, they all get out, but my father and I stayed in the limousine, and no sooner than the women got out, he burst out crying. 
He didn't want cry in front of me, but he knew he wasn't going to make it back to the city, and it was better me than to allow himself to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women. 
And this is a man who, 10 minutes ago, had just put his teenage son in the ground -- something I just can't even imagine. 
The thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me for crying in front of me, and at the same time, he was also giving me props, lifting me up, for not crying. 
I come to also look at this as this fear that we have as men, this fear that just has us paralyzed, holding us hostage to this man box. 
I can remember speaking to a 12-year-old boy, a football player, and I asked him, I said, "How would you feel if, in front of all the players, your coach told you you were playing like a girl?" 
Now I expected him to say something like, I'd be sad; I'd be mad; I'd be angry, or something like that. 
No, the boy said to me -- the boy said to me, "It would destroy me." 
And I said to myself, "God, if it would destroy him to be called a girl, what are we then teaching him about girls?" 
(Applause) It took me back to a time when I was about 12 years old. 
I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city. 
At this time we're living in the Bronx, and in the building next to where I lived there was a guy named Johnny. 
He was about 16 years old, and we were all about 12 years old -- younger guys. 
And he was hanging out with all us younger guys. 
And this guy, he was up to a lot of no good. 
He was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder, "What is this 16-year-old boy doing with these 12-year-old boys?" 
And he did spend a lot of time up to no good. 
He was a troubled kid. 
His mother had died from a heroin overdose. 
He was being raised by his grandmother. 
His father wasn't on the set. 
His grandmother had two jobs. 
He was home alone a lot. 
But I've got to tell you, we young guys, we looked up to this dude, man. 
He was cool. He was fine. 
That's what the sisters said, "He was fine." 
He was having sex. 
We all looked up to him. 
So one day, I'm out in front of the house doing something -- just playing around, doing something -- I don't know what. 
He looks out his window; he calls me upstairs; he said, "Hey Anthony." 
They called me Anthony growing up as a kid. 
"Hey Anthony, come on upstairs." 
Johnny call, you go. 
So I run right upstairs. 
As he opens the door, he says to me, "Do you want some?" 
Now I immediately knew what he meant. 
Because for me growing up at that time, and our relationship with this man box, "Do you want some?" meant one of two things: sex or drugs -- and we weren't doing drugs. 
Now my box, my card, my man box card, was immediately in jeopardy. 
Two things: One, I never had sex. 
We don't talk about that as men. 
You only tell your dearest, closest friend, sworn to secrecy for life, the first time you had sex. 
For everybody else, we go around like we've been having sex since we were two. 
There ain't no first time. 
(Laughter) The other thing I couldn't tell him is that I didn't want any. 
That's even worse. We're supposed to always be on the prowl. 
Women are objects, especially sexual objects. 
Anyway, so I couldn't tell him any of that. 
So, like my mother would say, make a long story short, I just simply said to Johnny, "Yes." 
He told me to go in his room. 
I go in his room. On his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named Sheila. 
She's 16 years old. 
She's nude. 
She's what I know today to be mentally ill, higher-functioning at times than others. 
We had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her. 
Anyway, Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her. 
Well actually, he raped her, but he would say he had sex with her. 
Because, while Sheila never said no, she also never said yes. 
So he was offering me the opportunity to do the same. 
So when I go in the room, I close the door. 
Folks, I'm petrified. 
I stand with my back to the door so Johnny can't bust in the room and see that I'm not doing anything, and I stand there long enough that I could have actually done something. 
So now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do; I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this room. 
So in my 12 years of wisdom, I zip my pants down, I walk out into the room, and lo and behold to me, while I was in the room with Sheila, Johnny was back at the window calling guys up. 
So now there's a living room full of guys. 
It was like the waiting room in the doctor's office. 
And they asked me how was it, and I say to them, "It was good," and I zip my pants up in front of them, and I head for the door. 
Now I say this all with remorse, and I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time, but I was conflicted, because, while I was feeling remorse, I was excited, because I didn't get caught. 
But I knew I felt bad about what was happening. 
This fear, getting outside the man box, totally enveloped me. 
It was way more important to me, about me and my man box card than about Sheila and what was happening to her. 
See collectively, we as men are taught to have less value in women, to view them as property and the objects of men. 
We see that as an equation that equals violence against women. 
We as men, good men, the large majority of men, we operate on the foundation of this whole collective socialization. 
We kind of see ourselves separate, but we're very much a part of it. 
You see, we have to come to understand that less value, property and objectification is the foundation and the violence can't happen without it. 
So we're very much a part of the solution as well as the problem. 
The center for disease control says that men's violence against women is at epidemic proportions, is the number one health concern for women in this country and abroad. 
So quickly, I'd like to just say, this is the love of my life, my daughter Jay. 
The world I envision for her -- how do I want men to be acting and behaving? 
I need you on board. I need you with me. 
I need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men -- that it's okay to not be dominating, that it's okay to have feelings and emotions, that it's okay to promote equality, that it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it, that it's okay to be whole, that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman. (Applause) I remember asking a nine-year-old boy, I asked a nine-year-old boy, "What would life be like for you, if you didn't have to adhere to this man box?" 
He said to me, "I would be free." 
Thank you folks. 
(Applause) 

Now I'm going to give you a story. 
It's an Indian story about an Indian woman and her journey. 
Let me begin with my parents. 
I'm a product of this visionary mother and father. 
Many years ago, when I was born in the '50s -- '50s and '60s didn't belong to girls in India. 
They belonged to boys. 
They belonged to boys who would join business and inherit business from parents, and girls would be dolled up to get married. 
My family, in my city, and almost in the country, was unique. 
We were four of us, not one, and fortunately no boys. 
We were four girls and no boys. 
And my parents were part of a landed property family. 
My father defied his own grandfather, almost to the point of disinheritance, because he decided to educate all four of us. 
He sent us to one of the best schools in the city and gave us the best education. 
As I've said, when we're born, we don't choose our parents, and when we go to school, we don't choose our school. 
Children don't choose a school. 
They just get the school which parents choose for them. 
So this is the foundation time which I got. 
I grew up like this, and so did my other three sisters. 
And my father used to say at that time, "I'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world." 
I don't know if he really meant [that], but it happened. 
I'm the only one who's left in India. 
One is a British, another is an American and the third is a Canadian. 
So we are four of us in four corners of the world. 
And since I said they're my role models, I followed two things which my father and mother gave me. 
One, they said, "Life is on an incline. 
You either go up, or you come down." 
And the second thing, which has stayed with me, which became my philosophy of life, which made all the difference, is: 100 things happen in your life, good or bad. 
Out of 100, 90 are your creation. 
They're good. They're your creation. Enjoy it. 
If they're bad, they're your creation. Learn from it. 
Ten are nature-sent over which you can't do a thing. 
It's like a death of a relative, or a cyclone, or a hurricane, or an earthquake. 
You can't do a thing about it. 
You've got to just respond to the situation. 
But that response comes out of those 90 points. 
Since I'm a product of this philosophy, of 90/10, and secondly, "life on an incline," that's the way I grew up to be valuing what I got. 
I'm a product of opportunities, rare opportunities in the '50s and the '60s, which girls didn't get, and I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me was something unique. 
Because all of my best school friends were getting dolled up to get married with a lot of dowry, and here I was with a tennis racket and going to school and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities. 
I thought I must tell you this. 
Why I said this, is the background. 
This is what comes next. 
I joined the Indian Police Service as a tough woman, a woman with indefatigable stamina, because I used to run for my tennis titles, etc. 
But I joined the Indian Police Service, and then it was a new pattern of policing. 
For me the policing stood for power to correct, power to prevent and power to detect. 
This is something like a new definition ever given in policing in India -- the power to prevent. 
Because normally it was always said, power to detect, and that's it, or power to punish. 
But I decided no, it's a power to prevent, because that's what I learned when I was growing up. 
How do I prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10? 
So this was how it came into my service, and it was different from the men. 
I didn't want to make it different from the men, but it was different, because this was the way I was different. 
And I redefined policing concepts in India. 
I'm going to take you on two journeys, my policing journey and my prison journey. 
What you see, if you see the title called "PM's car held." 
This was the first time a prime minister of India was given a parking ticket. 
(Laughter) That's the first time in India, and I can tell you, that's the last time you're hearing about it. 
It'll never happen again in India, because now it was once and forever. 
And the rule was, because I was sensitive, I was compassionate, I was very sensitive to injustice, and I was very pro-justice. 
That's the reason, as a woman, I joined the Indian Police Service. 
I had other options, but I didn't choose them. 
So I'm going to move on. 
This is about tough policing, equal policing. 
Now I was known as "here's a woman that's not going to listen." 
So I was sent to all indiscriminate postings, postings which others would say no. 
I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer. 
Normally police officers don't want to do prison. 
They sent me to prison to lock me up, thinking, "Now there will be no cars and no VIPs to be given tickets to. 
Let's lock her up." 
Here I got a prison assignment. 
This was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals. 
Obviously, it was. 
But 10,000 men, of which only 400 were women -- 10,000 -- 9,000 plus about 600 were men. 
Terrorists, rapists, burglars, gangsters -- some of them I'd sent to jail as a police officer outside. 
And then how did I deal with them? 
The first day when I went in, I didn't know how to look at them. 
And I said, "Do you pray?" When I looked at the group, I said, "Do you pray?" 
They saw me as a young, short woman wearing a pathan suit. 
I said, "Do you pray?" 
And they didn't say anything. 
I said, "Do you pray? Do you want to pray?" 
They said, "Yes." I said, "All right, let's pray." 
I prayed for them, and things started to change. 
This is a visual of education inside the prison. 
Friends, this has never happened, where everybody in the prison studies. 
I started this with community support. 
Government had no budget. 
It was one of the finest, largest volunteerism in any prison in the world. 
This was initiated in Delhi prison. 
You see one sample of a prisoner teaching a class. 
These are hundreds of classes. 
Nine to eleven, every prisoner went into the education program -- the same den in which they thought they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten. 
We converted this into an ashram -- from a prison to an ashram through education. 
I think that's the bigger change. 
It was the beginning of a change. 
Teachers were prisoners. Teachers were volunteers. 
Books came from donated schoolbooks. 
Stationery was donated. 
Everything was donated, because there was no budget of education for the prison. 
Now if I'd not done that, it would have been a hellhole. 
That's the second landmark. 
I want to show you some moments of history in my journey, which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world. 
One, the numbers you'll never get to see. 
Secondly, this concept. 
This was a meditation program inside the prison of over 1,000 prisoners. 
One thousand prisoners who sat in meditation. 
This was one of the most courageous steps I took as a prison governor. 
And this is what transformed. 
You want to know more about this, go and see this film, "Doing Time, Doing Vipassana." 
You will hear about it, and you will love it. 
And write to me on KiranBedi.com, and I'll respond to you. 
Let me show you the next slide. 
I took the same concept of mindfulness, because, why did I bring meditation into the Indian prison? 
Because crime is a product of a distorted mind. 
It was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control. 
Not by preaching, not by telling, not by reading, but by addressing your mind. 
I took the same thing to the police, because police, equally, were prisoners of their minds, and they felt as if it was "we" and "they," and that the people don't cooperate. 
This worked. 
This is a feedback box called a petition box. 
This is a concept which I introduced to listen to complaints, listen to grievances. 
This was a magic box. 
This was a sensitive box. 
This is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison. 
If you see somebody in the blue -- yeah, this guy -- he was a prisoner, and he was a teacher. 
And you see, everybody's busy. There was no time to waste. 
Let me wrap it up. 
I'm currently into movements, movements of education of the under-served children, which is thousands -- India is all about thousands. 
Secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in India. 
That's a big way we, as a small group of activists, have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of India. 
Friends, you will hear a lot about it. 
That's the movement at the moment I'm driving, and that's the movement and ambition of my life. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. 
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 

We are now going through an amazing and unprecedented moment where the power dynamics between men and women are shifting very rapidly, and in many of the places where it counts the most, women are, in fact, taking control of everything. 
In my mother's day, she didn't go to college. 
Not a lot of women did. 
And now, for every two men who get a college degree, three women will do the same. 
Women, for the first time this year, became the majority of the American workforce. 
And they're starting to dominate lots of professions -- doctors, lawyers, bankers, accountants. 
Over 50 percent of managers are women these days, and in the 15 professions projected to grow the most in the next decade, all but two of them are dominated by women. 
So the global economy is becoming a place where women are more successful than men, believe it or not, and these economic changes are starting to rapidly affect our culture -- what our romantic comedies look like, what our marriages look like, what our dating lives look like, and our new set of superheroes. 
For a long time, this is the image of American manhood that dominated -- tough, rugged, in control of his own environment. 
A few years ago, the Marlboro Man was retired and replaced by this much less impressive specimen, who is a parody of American manhood, and that's what we have in our commercials today. 
The phrase "first-born son" is so deeply ingrained in our consciousness that this statistic alone shocked me. 
In American fertility clinics, 75 percent of couples are requesting girls and not boys. 
And in places where you wouldn't think, such as South Korea, India and China, the very strict patriarchal societies are starting to break down a little, and families are no longer strongly preferring first-born sons. 
If you think about this, if you just open your eyes to this possibility and start to connect the dots, you can see the evidence everywhere. 
You can see it in college graduation patterns, in job projections, in our marriage statistics, you can see it in the Icelandic elections, which you'll hear about later, and you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference, that something amazing and unprecedented is happening with women. 
Certainly this is not the first time that we've had great progress with women. 
The '20s and the '60s also come to mind. 
But the difference is that, back then, it was driven by a very passionate feminist movement that was trying to project its own desires, whereas this time, it's not about passion, and it's not about any kind of movement. 
This is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in. 
The 200,000-year period in which men have been top dog is truly coming to an end, believe it or not, and that's why I talk about the "end of men." 
Now all you men out there, this is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes, because the point is that this is happening to all of us. 
I myself have a husband and a father and two sons whom I dearly love. 
And this is why I like to talk about this, because if we don't acknowledge it, then the transition will be pretty painful. 
But if we do take account of it, then I think it will go much more smoothly. 
I first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago. 
I was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else, and I started to notice a distinct pattern -- that the recession was affecting men much more deeply than it was affecting women. 
And I remembered back to about 10 years ago when I read a book by Susan Faludi called "Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man," in which she described how hard the recession had hit men, and I started to think about whether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession. 
And I realized that two things were different this time around. 
The first was that these were no longer just temporary hits that the recession was giving men -- that this was reflecting a deeper underlying shift in our global economy. 
And second, that the story was no longer just about the crisis of men, but it was also about what was happening to women. 
And now look at this second set of slides. 
These are headlines about what's been going on with women in the next few years. 
These are things we never could have imagined a few years ago. 
Women, a majority of the workplace. 
And labor statistics: women take up most managerial jobs. 
This second set of headlines -- you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift. 
And look at that last headline -- young women earning more than young men. 
That particular headline comes to me from a market research firm. 
They were basically asked by one of their clients who was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future. 
And they expected that it would be young families, or young men, just like it had always been. 
But in fact, they found something very surprising. 
It was young, single women who were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood. 
And so they decided, because they were intrigued by this finding, to do a nationwide survey. 
So they spread out all the census data, and what they found, the guy described to me as a shocker, which is that in 1,997 out of 2,000 communities, women, young women, were making more money than young men. 
So here you have a generation of young women who grow up thinking of themselves as being more powerful earners than the young men around them. 
Now, I've just laid out the picture for you, but I still haven't explained to you why this is happening. 
And in a moment, I'm going to show you a graph, and what you'll see on this graph -- it begins in 1973, just before women start flooding the workforce, and it brings us up to our current day. 
And basically what you'll see is what economists talk about as the polarization of the economy. 
Now what does that mean? 
It means that the economy is dividing into high-skill, high-wage jobs and low-skill, low-wage jobs -- and that the middle, the middle-skill jobs, and the middle-earning jobs, are starting to drop out of the economy. 
This has been going on for 40 years now. 
But this process is affecting men very differently than it's affecting women. 
You'll see the women in red, and you'll see the men in blue. 
You'll watch them both drop out of the middle class, but see what happens to women and see what happens to men. 
There we go. 
So watch that. You see them both drop out of the middle class. 
Watch what happens to the women. Watch what happens to the men. 
The men sort of stagnate there, while the women zoom up in those high-skill jobs. 
So what's that about? 
It looks like women got some power boost on a video game, or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills that lets them shoot up high. 
But of course, it's not about that. 
What it's about is that the economy has changed a lot. 
We used to have a manufacturing economy, which was about building goods and products, and now we have a service economy and an information and creative economy. 
Those two economies require very different skills, and as it happens, women have been much better at acquiring the new set of skills than men have been. 
It used to be that you were a guy who went to high school who didn't have a college degree, but you had a specific set of skills, and with the help of a union, you could make yourself a pretty good middle-class life. 
But that really isn't true anymore. 
This new economy is pretty indifferent to size and strength, which is what's helped men along all these years. 
What the economy requires now is a whole different set of skills. 
You basically need intelligence, you need an ability to sit still and focus, to communicate openly, to be able to listen to people and to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be, and those are things that women do extremely well, as we're seeing. 
If you look at management theory these days, it used to be that our ideal leader sounded something like General Patton, right? 
You would be issuing orders from above. 
You would be very hierarchical. 
You would tell everyone below you what to do. 
But that's not what an ideal leader is like now. 
If you read management books now, a leader is somebody who can foster creativity, who can get his -- get the employees -- see, I still say "his" -- who can get the employees to talk to each other, who can basically build teams and get them to be creative. 
And those are all things that women do very well. 
And then on top of that, that's created a kind of cascading effect. 
Women enter the workplace at the top, and then at the working class, all the new jobs that are created are the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home. 
So that's childcare, elder care and food preparation. 
So those are all the jobs that are growing, and those are jobs that women tend to do. 
Now one day it might be that mothers will hire an out-of-work, middle-aged, former steelworker guy to watch their children at home, and that would be good for the men, but that hasn't quite happened yet. 
To see what's going to happen, you can't just look at the workforce that is now, you have to look at our future workforce. 
And here the story is fairly simple. 
Women are getting college degrees at a faster rate than men. 
Why? This is a real mystery. 
People have asked men, why don't they just go back to college, to community college, say, and retool themselves, learn a new set of skills? 
Well it turns out that they're just very uncomfortable doing that. 
They're used to thinking of themselves as providers, and they can't seem to build the social networks that allow them to get through college. 
So for some reason men just don't end up going back to college. 
And what's even more disturbing is what's happening with younger boys. 
There's been about a decade of research about what people are calling the "boy crisis." 
Now the boy crisis is this idea that very young boys, for whatever reason, are doing worse in school than very young girls, and people have theories about that. 
Is it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum, and little girls are better at that than little boys? 
Or that we require kids to sit still too much, and so boys initially feel like failures? 
And some people say it's because, in 9th grade, boys start dropping out of school. 
Because I'm writing a book about all this, I'm still looking into it, so I don't have the answer. 
But in the mean time, I'm going to call on the worldwide education expert, who's my 10-year-old daughter, Noa, to talk to you about why the boys in her class do worse. 
(Video) Noa: The girls are obviously smarter. 
I mean they have much larger vocabulary. 
They learn much faster. 
They are more controlled. 
On the board today for losing recess tomorrow, only boys. 
Hanna Rosin: And why is that? 
Noa: Why? They were just not listening to the class while the girls sat there very nicely. 
HR: So there you go. 
This whole thesis really came home to me when I went to visit a college in Kansas City -- working-class college. 
Certainly, when I was in college, I had certain expectations about my life -- that my husband and I would both work, and that we would equally raise the children. 
But these college girls had a completely different view of their future. 
Basically, the way they said it to me is that they would be working 18 hours a day, that their husband would maybe have a job, but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies. 
And this was kind of a shocker to me. 
And then here's my favorite quote from one of the girls: "Men are the new ball and chain." 
(Laughter) Now you laugh, but that quote has kind of a sting to it, right? 
And I think the reason it has a sting is because thousands of years of history don't reverse themselves without a lot of pain, and that's why I talk about us all going through this together. 
The night after I talked to these college girls, I also went to a men's group in Kansas, and these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy which I spoke to you about earlier. 
They were men who had been contractors, or they had been building houses and they had lost their jobs after the housing boom, and they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support. 
And the instructor was up there in the class explaining to them all the ways in which they had lost their identity in this new age. 
He was telling them they no longer had any moral authority, that nobody needed them for emotional support anymore, and they were not really the providers. 
So who were they? 
And this was very disheartening for them. 
And what he did was he wrote down on the board "$85,000," and he said, "That's her salary," and then he wrote down "$12,000." 
"That's your salary. 
So who's the man now?" he asked them. 
"Who's the damn man? 
She's the man now." 
And that really sent a shudder through the room. 
And that's part of the reason I like to talk about this, because I think it can be pretty painful, and we really have to work through it. 
And the other reason it's kind of urgent is because it's not just happening in the U.S. 
It's happening all over the world. 
In India, poor women are learning English faster than their male counterparts in order to staff the new call centers that are growing in India. 
In China, a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship is happening because women are starting businesses, small businesses, faster than men. 
And here's my favorite example, which is in South Korea. 
Over several decades, South Korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about. 
They basically enshrined the second-class status of women in the civil code. 
And if women failed to birth male children, they were basically treated like domestic servants. 
And sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child so they could have a male child. 
But over the '70s and '80s, the South Korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize, and so what they did was, they started to push women into the workforce. 
Now they've been asking a question since 1985: "How strongly do you prefer a first-born son?" 
And now look at the chart. 
That's from 1985 to 2003. 
How much do you prefer a first-born son? 
So you can see that these economic changes really do have a strong effect on our culture. 
Now because we haven't fully processed this information, it's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways, where you can see that the stereotypes are changing. 
And so we have on the male side what one of my colleagues likes to call the "omega males" popping up, who are the males who are romantically challenged losers who can't find a job. 
And they come up in lots of different forms. 
So we have the perpetual adolescent. 
We have the charmless misanthrope. 
Then we have our Bud Light guy who's the happy couch potato. 
And then here's a shocker: even America's most sexiest man alive, the sexiest man alive gets romantically played these days in a movie. 
And then on the female side, you have the opposite, in which you have these crazy superhero women. 
You've got Lady Gaga. 
You've got our new James Bond, who's Angelina Jolie. 
And it's not just for the young, right? 
Even Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days. 
And so it feels like we have to move from this place where we've got these uber-exaggerated images into something that feels a little more normal. 
So for a long time in the economic sphere, we've lived with the term "glass ceiling." 
Now I've never really liked this term. 
For one thing, it puts men and women in a really antagonistic relationship with one another, because the men are these devious tricksters up there who've put up this glass ceiling. 
And we're always below the glass ceiling, the women. 
And we have a lot of skill and experience, but it's a trick, so how are you supposed to prepare to get through that glass ceiling? 
And also, "shattering the glass ceiling" is a terrible phrase. 
What crazy person would pop their head through a glass ceiling? 
So the image that I like to think of, instead of glass ceiling, is the high bridge. 
It's definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge, but it's also pretty exhilarating, because it's beautiful up there, and you're looking out on a beautiful view. 
And the great thing is there's no trick like with the glass ceiling. 
There's no man or woman standing in the middle about to cut the cables. 
There's no hole in the middle that you're going to fall through. 
And the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you. 
You can bring your husband along. 
You can bring your friends, or your colleagues, or your babysitter to walk along with you. 
And husbands can drag their wives across, if their wives don't feel ready. 
But the point about the high bridge is that you have to have the confidence to know that you deserve to be on that bridge, that you have all the skills and experience you need in order to walk across the high bridge, but you just have to make the decision to take the first step and do it. 
Thanks very much. 
(Applause) 

I have been teaching for a long time, and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that I really wish more people would understand about the potential of students. 
In 1931, my grandmother -- bottom left for you guys over here -- graduated from the eighth grade. 
She went to school to get the information because that's where the information lived. 
It was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head; and she needed to go there to get the information, because that's how you learned. 
Fast-forward a generation: this is the one-room schoolhouse, Oak Grove, where my father went to a one-room schoolhouse. 
And he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher, stored it in the only portable memory he has, which is inside his own head, and take it with him, because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world. 
When I was a kid, we had a set of encyclopedias at my house. 
It was purchased the year I was born, and it was extraordinary, because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information. 
The information was inside my house and it was awesome. 
This was different than either generation had experienced before, and it changed the way I interacted with information even at just a small level. 
But the information was closer to me. 
I could get access to it. 
In the time that passes between when I was a kid in high school and when I started teaching, we really see the advent of the Internet. 
Right about the time that the Internet gets going as an educational tool, I take off from Wisconsin and move to Kansas, small town Kansas, where I had an opportunity to teach in a lovely, small-town, rural Kansas school district, where I was teaching my favorite subject, American government. 
My first year -- super gung-ho -- going to teach American government, loved the political system. 
Kids in the 12th grade: not exactly all that enthusiastic about the American government system. 
Year two: learned a few things -- had to change my tactic. 
And I put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves. 
I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it. 
I posed a problem in front of them, which was to put on an election forum for their own community. 
They produced flyers. They called offices. 
They checked schedules. They were meeting with secretaries. 
They produced an election forum booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates. 
They invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and whether or not the streets were done well, and really had this robust experiential learning. 
The older teachers -- more experienced -- looked at me and went, "Oh, there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done." 
(Laughter) "She doesn't know what she's in for." 
But I knew that the kids would show up, and I believed it, and I told them every week what I expected out of them. 
And that night, all 90 kids -- dressed appropriately, doing their job, owning it. 
I had to just sit and watch. 
It was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic. 
It meant something to them. 
And they will step up. 
From Kansas, I moved on to lovely Arizona, where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years, this time with middle school students. 
Luckily, I didn't have to teach them American government. 
Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography. 
Again, "thrilled" to learn. 
But what was interesting about this position I found myself in in Arizona, was I had this really extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with in a truly public school, and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities. 
And one opportunity was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina, which is the gentleman that the movie "Hotel Rwanda" is based after. 
And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us. 
We could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses. 
There was no expense cost. Perfect field trip. 
The problem then becomes how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful, and they know what to do with it. 
And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who singularly used his life to do something positive. 
I then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life, or in their own story, or in their own world, that they could identify that had done a similar thing. 
I asked them to produce a little movie about it. 
It's the first time we'd done this. 
Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer, but they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it. 
It was the most awesome moment of revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves, what they're willing to share. 
The last question of the assignment is: how do you plan to use your life to positively impact other people? 
The things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary. 
Fast-forward to Pennsylvania, where I find myself today. 
I teach at the Science Leadership Academy, which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute and the school district of Philadelphia. 
We are a nine through 12 public school, but we do school quite differently. 
I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learned, and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past, of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school, and to a moment when we have information surplus. 
So what do you do when the information is all around you? 
Why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information? 
In Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program, so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday, taking them home, getting access to information. 
And here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you've given the tool to acquire information to students, is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process. 
We deal right now in the educational landscape with an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test, and I am here to share with you: it is not learning. 
That is the absolute wrong thing to ask, to tell kids to never be wrong. 
To ask them to always have the right answer doesn't allow them to learn. 
So we did this project, and this is one of the artifacts of the project. 
I almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure. 
My students produced these info-graphics as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill. 
I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the info-graphics that existed in a lot of mass media, and take a look at what were the interesting components of it, and produce one for themselves of a different man-made disaster from American history. 
And they had certain criteria to do it. 
They were a little uncomfortable with it, because we'd never done this before, and they didn't know exactly how to do it. 
They can talk -- they're very smooth, and they can write very, very well, but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them. 
But I gave them the room to just do the thing. 
Go create. Go figure it out. 
Let's see what we can do. 
And the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint. 
This was done in like two or three days. 
And this is the work of the student that consistently did it. 
And when I sat the students down, I said, "Who's got the best one?" 
And they immediately went, "There it is." 
Didn't read anything. "There it is." 
And I said, "Well what makes it great?" 
And they're like, "Oh, the design's good, and he's using good color. 
And there's some ... " And they went through all that we processed out loud. 
And I said, "Go read it." 
And they're like, "Oh, that one wasn't so awesome." 
And then we went to another one -- it didn't have great visuals, but it had great information -- and spent an hour talking about the learning process, because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect, or whether or not it was what I could create. 
It asked them to create for themselves, and it allowed them to fail, process, learn from. 
And when we do another round of this in my class this year, they will do better this time, because learning has to include an amount of failure, because failure is instructional in the process. 
There are a million pictures that I could click through here, and had to choose carefully -- this is one of my favorites -- of students learning, of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information, but instead, ask them what they can do with it. 
Ask them really interesting questions. 
They will not disappoint. 
Ask them to go to places, to see things for themselves, to actually experience the learning, to play, to inquire. 
This is one of my favorite photos, because this was taken on Tuesday, when I asked the students to go to the polls. 
This is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting, and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that. 
But this is learning too, because we asked them to go out into real spaces. 
The main point is that, if we continue to look at education as if it's about coming to school to get the information and not about experiential learning, empowering student voice and embracing failure, we're missing the mark. 
And everything that everybody is talking about today isn't possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities, because we won't get there with a standardized test, and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer. 
We know how to do this better, and it's time to do better. 
(Applause) 

Alisa Volkman: So this is where our story begins -- the dramatic moments of the birth of our first son, Declan. 
Obviously a really profound moment, and it changed our lives in many ways. 
It also changed our lives in many unexpected ways, and those unexpected ways we later reflected on, that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us, and a year later, we launched Babble, a website for parents. 
Rufus Griscom: Now I think of our story as starting a few years earlier. AV: That's true. 
RG: You may remember, we fell head over heels in love. 
AV: We did. 
RG: We were at the time running a very different kind of website. 
It was a website called Nerve.com, the tagline of which was "literate smut." 
It was in theory, and hopefully in practice, a smart online magazine about sex and culture. 
AV: That spawned a dating site. 
But you can understand the jokes that we get. Sex begets babies. 
You follow instructions on Nerve and you should end up on Babble, which we did. 
And we might launch a geriatric site as our third. We'll see. 
RG: But for us, the continuity between Nerve and Babble was not just the life stage thing, which is, of course, relevant, but it was really more about our desire to speak very honestly about subjects that people have difficulty speaking honestly about. 
It seems to us that when people start dissembling, people start lying about things, that's when it gets really interesting. 
That's a subject that we want to dive into. 
And we've been surprised to find, as young parents, that there are almost more taboos around parenting than there are around sex. 
AV: It's true. So like we said, the early years were really wonderful, but they were also really difficult. 
And we feel like some of that difficulty was because of this false advertisement around parenting. 
(Laughter) We subscribed to a lot of magazines, did our homework, but really everywhere you look around, we were surrounded by images like this. 
And we went into parenting expecting our lives to look like this. 
The sun was always streaming in, and our children would never be crying. 
I would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested, and in fact, it was not like that at all. 
RG: When we lowered the glossy parenting magazine that we were looking at, with these beautiful images, and looked at the scene in our actual living room, it looked a little bit more like this. 
These are our three sons. 
And of course, they're not always crying and screaming, but with three boys, there's a decent probability that at least one of them will not be comporting himself exactly as he should. 
AV: Yes, you can see where the disconnect was happening for us. 
We really felt like what we went in expecting had nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing, and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight. 
We really wanted to let them understand what the realities of parenting were in an honest way. 
RG: So today, what we would love to do is share with you four parenting taboos. 
And of course, there are many more than four things you can't say about parenting, but we would like to share with you today four that are particularly relevant for us personally. 
So the first, taboo number one: you can't say you didn't fall in love with your baby in the very first minute. 
I remember vividly, sitting there in the hospital. 
We were in the process of giving birth to our first child. 
AV: We, or I? 
RG: I'm sorry. 
Misuse of the pronoun. 
Alisa was very generously in the process of giving birth to our first child -- (AV: Thank you.) -- and I was there with a catcher's mitt. 
And I was there with my arms open. 
The nurse was coming at me with this beautiful, beautiful child, and I remember, as she was approaching me, the voices of friends saying, "The moment they put the baby in your hands, you will feel a sense of love that will come over you that is [on] an order of magnitude more powerful than anything you've ever experienced in your entire life." 
So I was bracing myself for the moment. 
The baby was coming, and I was ready for this Mack truck of love to just knock me off my feet. 
And instead, when the baby was placed in my hands, it was an extraordinary moment. 
This picture is from literally a few seconds after the baby was placed in my hands and I brought him over. 
And you can see, our eyes were glistening. 
I was overwhelmed with love and affection for my wife, with deep, deep gratitude that we had what appeared to be a healthy child. 
And it was also, of course, surreal. 
I mean, I had to check the tags and make sure. 
I was incredulous, "Are you sure this is our child?" 
And this was all quite remarkable. 
But what I felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection, but nothing like what I feel for him now, five years later. 
And so we've done something here that is heretical. 
We have charted our love for our child over time. 
(Laughter) This, as you know, is an act of heresy. 
You're not allowed to chart love. 
The reason you're not allowed to chart love is because we think of love as a binary thing. 
You're either in love, or you're not in love. 
You love, or you don't love. 
And I think the reality is that love is a process, and I think the problem with thinking of love as something that's binary is that it causes us to be unduly concerned that love is fraudulent, or inadequate, or what have you. 
And I think I'm speaking obviously here to the father's experience. 
But I think a lot of men do go through this sense in the early months, maybe their first year, that their emotional response is inadequate in some fashion. 
AV: Well, I'm glad Rufus is bringing this up, because you can notice where he dips in the first years where I think I was doing most of the work. 
But we like to joke, in the first few months of all of our children's lives, this is Uncle Rufus. 
(Laughter) RG: I'm a very affectionate uncle, very affectionate uncle. 
AV: Yes, and I often joke with Rufus when he comes home that I'm not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a line-up amongst other babies. 
So I actually threw a pop quiz here onto Rufus. 
RG: Uh oh. 
AV: I don't want to embarrass him too much. But I am going to give him three seconds. 
RG: That is not fair. This is a trick question. He's not up there, is he? 
AV: Our eight-week-old son is somewhere in here, and I want to see if Rufus can actually quickly identify him. 
RG: The far left. AV: No! 
(Laughter) RG: Cruel. 
AV: Nothing more to be said. 
(Laughter) I'll move on to taboo number two. 
You can't talk about how lonely having a baby can be. 
I enjoyed being pregnant. I loved it. 
I felt incredibly connected to the community around me. 
I felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy, all around me, tracking it down till the actual due-date. 
I felt like I was a vessel of the future of humanity. 
That continued into the the hospital. It was really exhilarating. 
I was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors. 
It was a really wonderful experience, but when I got home, I suddenly felt very disconnected and suddenly shut in and shut out, and I was really surprised by those feelings. 
I did expect it to be difficult, have sleepless nights, constant feedings, but I did not expect the feelings of isolation and loneliness that I experienced, and I was really surprised that no one had talked to me, that I was going to be feeling this way. 
And I called my sister whom I'm very close to -- and had three children -- and I asked her, "Why didn't you tell me I was going to be feeling this way, that I was going to have these -- feeling incredibly isolated?" 
And she said -- I'll never forget -- "It's just not something you want to say to a mother that's having a baby for the first time." 
RG: And of course, we think it's precisely what you really should be saying to mothers who have kids for the first time. 
And that this, of course, one of the themes for us is that we think that candor and brutal honesty is critical to us collectively being great parents. 
And it's hard not to think that part of what leads to this sense of isolation is our modern world. 
So Alisa's experience is not isolated. 
So your 58 percent of mothers surveyed report feelings of loneliness. 
Of those, 67 percent are most lonely when their kids are zero to five -- probably really zero to two. 
In the process of preparing this, we looked at how some other cultures around the world deal with this period of time, because here in the Western world, less than 50 percent of us live near our family members, which I think is part of why this is such a tough period. 
So to take one example among many: in Southern India there's a practice known as jholabhari, in which the pregnant woman, when she's seven or eight months pregnant, moves in with her mother and goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies, give birth and returns home to her nuclear family several months after the child is born. 
And this is one of many ways that we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period. 
AV: So taboo number three: you can't talk about your miscarriage -- but today I'll talk about mine. 
So after we had Declan, we kind of recalibrated our expectations. 
We thought we actually could go through this again and thought we knew what we would be up against. 
And we were grateful that I was able to get pregnant, and I soon learned that we were having a boy, and then when I was five months, we learned that we had lost our child. 
This is actually the last little image we have of him. 
And it was obviously a very difficult time -- really painful. 
As I was working through that mourning process, I was amazed that I didn't want to see anybody. 
I really wanted to crawl into a hole, and I didn't really know how I was going to work my way back into my surrounding community. 
And I realize, I think, the way I was feeling that way, is on a really deep gut level, I was feeling a lot of shame and embarrassed, frankly, that, in some respects, I had failed at delivering what I'm genetically engineered to do. 
And of course, it made me question, if I wasn't able to have another child, what would that mean for my marriage, and just me as a woman. 
So it was a very difficult time. 
As I started working through it more, I started climbing out of that hole and talking with other people. 
I was really amazed by all the stories that started flooding in. 
People I interacted with daily, worked with, was friends with, family members that I had known a long time, had never shared with me their own stories. 
And I just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork, and I felt like I happened upon this secret society of women that I now was a part of, which was reassuring and also really concerning. 
And I think, miscarriage is an invisible loss. 
There's not really a lot of community support around it. 
There's really no ceremony, rituals, or rites. 
And I think, with a death, you have a funeral, you celebrate the life, and there's a lot of community support, and it's something women don't have with miscarriage. 
RG: Which is too bad because, of course, it's a very common and very traumatic experience. 
Fifteen to 20 percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage, and I find this astounding. 
In a survey, 74 percent of women said that miscarriage, they felt, was partly their fault, which is awful. 
And astoundingly, 22 percent said they would hide a miscarriage from their spouse. 
So taboo number four: you can't say that your average happiness has declined since having a child. 
The party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since I participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family. 
I'll never forget, I remember vividly to this day, our first son, Declan, was nine months old, and I was sitting there on the couch, and I was reading Daniel Gilbert's wonderful book, "Stumbling on Happiness." 
And I got about two-thirds of the way through, and there was a chart on the right-hand side -- on the right-hand page -- that we've labeled here "The Most Terrifying Chart Imaginable for a New Parent." 
This chart is comprised of four completely independent studies. 
Basically, there's this precipitous drop of marital satisfaction, which is closely aligned, we all know, with broader happiness, that doesn't rise again until your first child goes to college. 
So I'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life, this chasm of happiness that we're driving our proverbial convertible straight into. 
We were despondent. 
AV: So you can imagine, I mean again, the first few months were difficult, but we'd come out of it, and were really shocked to see this study. 
So we really wanted to take a deeper look at it in hopes that we would find a silver lining. 
RG: And that's when it's great to be running a website for parents, because we got this incredible reporter to go and interview all the scientists who conducted these four studies. 
We said, something is wrong here. 
There's something missing from these studies. 
It can't possibly be that bad. 
So Liz Mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece, and she interviewed four scientists, and she also interviewed Daniel Gilbert, and we did indeed find a silver lining. 
So this is our guess as to what this baseline of average happiness arguably looks like throughout life. 
Average happiness is, of course, inadequate, because it doesn't speak to the moment-by-moment experience, and so this is what we think it looks like when you layer in moment-to-moment experience. 
And so we all remember as children, the tiniest little thing -- and we see it on the faces of our children -- the teeniest little thing can just rocket them to these heights of just utter adulation, and then the next teeniest little thing can cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair. 
And it's just extraordinary to watch, and we remember it ourselves. 
And then, of course, as you get older, it's almost like age is a form of lithium. 
As you get older, you become more stable. 
And part of what happens, I think, in your '20s and '30s, is you start to learn to hedge your happiness. 
You start to realize that "Hey, I could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience that will cover my entire body with goosebumps, but it's more likely that I'll feel claustrophobic and I won't be able to get a beer. 
So I'm not going to go. 
I've got a good stereo at home. So, I'm not going to go." 
So your average happiness goes up, but you lose those transcendent moments. 
AV: Yeah, and then you have your first child, and then you really resubmit yourself to these highs and lows -- the highs being the first steps, the first smile, your child reading to you for the first time -- the lows being, our house, any time from six to seven every night. 
But you realize you resubmit yourself to losing control in a really wonderful way, which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives and is quite gratifying. 
RG: And so in effect, we trade average happiness. 
We trade the sort of security and safety of a certain level of contentment for these transcendent moments. 
So where does that leave the two of us as a family with our three little boys in the thick of all this? 
There's another factor in our case. 
We have violated yet another taboo in our own lives, and this is a bonus taboo. 
AV: A quick bonus taboo for you, that we should not be working together, especially with three children -- and we are. 
RG: And we had reservations about this on the front end. 
Everybody knows, you should absolutely not work with your spouse. 
In fact, when we first went out to raise money to start Babble, the venture capitalists said, "We categorically don't invest in companies founded by husbands and wives, because there's an extra point of failure. 
It's a bad idea. Don't do it." 
And we obviously went forward. We did. 
We raised the money, and we're thrilled that we did, because in this phase of one's life, the incredibly scarce resource is time. 
And if you're really passionate about what you do every day -- which we are -- and you're also passionate about your relationship, this is the only way we know how to do it. 
And so the final question that we would ask is: can we collectively bend that happiness chart upwards? 
It's great that we have these transcendent moments of joy, but they're sometimes pretty quick. 
And so how about that average baseline of happiness? 
Can we move that up a little bit? 
AV: And we kind of feel that the happiness gap, which we talked about, is really the result of walking into parenting -- and really any long-term partnership for that matter -- with the wrong expectations. 
And if you have the right expectations and expectation management, we feel like it's going to be a pretty gratifying experience. 
RG: And so this is what -- And we think that a lot of parents, when you get in there -- in our case anyway -- you pack your bags for a trip to Europe, and you're really excited to go. 
Get out of the airplane, it turns out you're trekking in Nepal. 
And trekking in Nepal is an extraordinary experience, particularly if you pack your bags properly and you know what you're getting in for and you're psyched. 
So the point of all this for us today is not just hopefully honesty for the sake of honesty, but a hope that by being more honest and candid about these experiences, that we can all collectively bend that happiness baseline up a little bit. 
RG + AV: Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I work on helping computers communicate about the world around us. 
There are a lot of ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers to talk about what they see and understand. 
Given a scene like this, a modern computer-vision algorithm can tell you that there's a woman and there's a dog. 
It can tell you that the woman is smiling. 
It might even be able to tell you that the dog is incredibly cute. 
I work on this problem thinking about how humans understand and process the world. 
The thoughts, memories and stories that a scene like this might evoke for humans. 
All the interconnections of related situations. 
Maybe you've seen a dog like this one before, or you've spent time running on a beach like this one, and that further evokes thoughts and memories of a past vacation, past times to the beach, times spent running around with other dogs. 
One of my guiding principles is that by helping computers to understand what it's like to have these experiences, to understand what we share and believe and feel, then we're in a great position to start evolving computer technology in a way that's complementary with our own experiences. 
So, digging more deeply into this, a few years ago I began working on helping computers to generate human-like stories from sequences of images. 
So, one day, I was working with my computer to ask it what it thought about a trip to Australia. 
It took a look at the pictures, and it saw a koala. 
It didn't know what the koala was, but it said it thought it was an interesting-looking creature. 
Then I shared with it a sequence of images about a house burning down. 
It took a look at the images and it said, "This is an amazing view! This is spectacular!" 
It sent chills down my spine. 
It saw a horrible, life-changing and life-destroying event and thought it was something positive. 
I realized that it recognized the contrast, the reds, the yellows, and thought it was something worth remarking on positively. 
And part of why it was doing this was because most of the images I had given it were positive images. 
That's because people tend to share positive images when they talk about their experiences. 
When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral? 
I realized that, as I worked on improving AI task by task, dataset by dataset, that I was creating massive gaps, holes and blind spots in what it could understand. 
And while doing so, I was encoding all kinds of biases. 
Biases that reflect a limited viewpoint, limited to a single dataset -- biases that can reflect human biases found in the data, such as prejudice and stereotyping. 
I thought back to the evolution of the technology that brought me to where I was that day -- how the first color images were calibrated against a white woman's skin, meaning that color photography was biased against black faces. 
And that same bias, that same blind spot continued well into the '90s. 
And the same blind spot continues even today in how well we can recognize different people's faces in facial recognition technology. 
I though about the state of the art in research today, where we tend to limit our thinking to one dataset and one problem. 
And that in doing so, we were creating more blind spots and biases that the AI could further amplify. 
I realized then that we had to think deeply about how the technology we work on today looks in five years, in 10 years. 
Humans evolve slowly, with time to correct for issues in the interaction of humans and their environment. 
In contrast, artificial intelligence is evolving at an incredibly fast rate. 
And that means that it really matters that we think about this carefully right now -- that we reflect on our own blind spots, our own biases, and think about how that's informing the technology we're creating and discuss what the technology of today will mean for tomorrow. 
CEOs and scientists have weighed in on what they think the artificial intelligence technology of the future will be. 
Stephen Hawking warns that "Artificial intelligence could end mankind." 
Elon Musk warns that it's an existential risk and one of the greatest risks that we face as a civilization. 
Bill Gates has made the point, "I don't understand why people aren't more concerned." 
But these views -- they're part of the story. 
The math, the models, the basic building blocks of artificial intelligence are something that we call access and all work with. 
We have open-source tools for machine learning and intelligence that we can contribute to. 
And beyond that, we can share our experience. 
We can share our experiences with technology and how it concerns us and how it excites us. 
We can discuss what we love. 
We can communicate with foresight about the aspects of technology that could be more beneficial or could be more problematic over time. 
If we all focus on opening up the discussion on AI with foresight towards the future, this will help create a general conversation and awareness about what AI is now, what it can become and all the things that we need to do in order to enable that outcome that best suits us. 
We already see and know this in the technology that we use today. 
We use smart phones and digital assistants and Roombas. 
Are they evil? 
Maybe sometimes. 
Are they beneficial? 
Yes, they're that, too. 
And they're not all the same. 
And there you already see a light shining on what the future holds. 
The future continues on from what we build and create right now. 
We set into motion that domino effect that carves out AI's evolutionary path. 
In our time right now, we shape the AI of tomorrow. 
Technology that immerses us in augmented realities bringing to life past worlds. 
Technology that helps people to share their experiences when they have difficulty communicating. 
Technology built on understanding the streaming visual worlds used as technology for self-driving cars. 
Technology built on understanding images and generating language, evolving into technology that helps people who are visually impaired be better able to access the visual world. 
And we also see how technology can lead to problems. 
We have technology today that analyzes physical characteristics we're born with -- such as the color of our skin or the look of our face -- in order to determine whether or not we might be criminals or terrorists. 
We have technology that crunches through our data, even data relating to our gender or our race, in order to determine whether or not we might get a loan. 
All that we see now is a snapshot in the evolution of artificial intelligence. 
Because where we are right now, is within a moment of that evolution. 
That means that what we do now will affect what happens down the line and in the future. 
If we want AI to evolve in a way that helps humans, then we need to define the goals and strategies that enable that path now. 
What I'd like to see is something that fits well with humans, with our culture and with the environment. 
Technology that aids and assists those of us with neurological conditions or other disabilities in order to make life equally challenging for everyone. 
Technology that works regardless of your demographics or the color of your skin. 
And so today, what I focus on is the technology for tomorrow and for 10 years from now. 
AI can turn out in many different ways. 
But in this case, it isn't a self-driving car without any destination. 
This is the car that we are driving. 
We choose when to speed up and when to slow down. 
We choose if we need to make a turn. 
We choose what the AI of the future will be. 
There's a vast playing field of all the things that artificial intelligence can become. 
It will become many things. 
And it's up to us now, in order to figure out what we need to put in place to make sure the outcomes of artificial intelligence are the ones that will be better for all of us. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So today I'm going to talk to you about the rise of collaborative consumption. 
I'm going to explain what it is and try and convince you -- in just 15 minutes -- that this isn't a flimsy idea, or a short-term trend, but a powerful cultural and economic force reinventing not just what we consume, but how we consume. 
Now I'm going to start with a deceptively simple example. 
Hands up -- how many of you have books, CDs, DVDs, or videos lying around your house that you probably won't use again, but you can't quite bring yourself to throw away? 
Can't see all the hands, but it looks like all of you, right? 
On our shelves at home, we have a box set of the DVD series "24," season six to be precise. 
I think it was bought for us around three years ago for a Christmas present. 
Now my husband, Chris, and I love this show. 
But let's face it, when you've watched it once maybe, or twice, you don't really want to watch it again, because you know how Jack Bauer is going to defeat the terrorists. 
So there it sits on our shelves obsolete to us, but with immediate latent value to someone else. 
Now before we go on, I have a confession to make. 
I lived in New York for 10 years, and I am a big fan of "Sex and the City." 
Now I'd love to watch the first movie again as sort of a warm-up to the sequel coming out next week. 
So how easily could I swap our unwanted copy of "24" for a wanted copy of "Sex and the City?" 
Now you may have noticed there's a new sector emerging called swap-trading. 
Now the easiest analogy for swap-trading is like an online dating service for all your unwanted media. 
What it does is use the Internet to create an infinite marketplace to match person A's "haves" with person C's "wants," whatever they may be. 
The other week, I went on one of these sites, appropriately called Swaptree, and there were over 59,300 items that I could instantly swap for my copy of "24." 
Lo and behold, there in Reseda, CA was Rondoron who wanted swap his or her "like new" copy of "Sex and the City" for my copy of "24." 
So in other words, what's happening here is that Swaptree solves my carrying company's sugar rush problem, a problem the economists call "the coincidence of wants," in approximately 60 seconds. 
What's even more amazing is it will print out a postage label on the spot, because it knows the way of the item. 
Now there are layers of technical wonder behind sites such as Swaptree, but that's not my interest, and nor is swap trading, per se. 
My passion, and what I've spent the last few years dedicated to researching, is the collaborative behaviors and trust-mechanics inherent in these systems. 
When you think about it, it would have seemed like a crazy idea, even a few years ago, that I would swap my stuff with a total stranger whose real name I didn't know and without any money changing hands. 
Yet 99 percent of trades on Swaptree happen successfully, and the one percent that receive a negative rating, it's for relatively minor reasons, like the item didn't arrive on time. 
So what's happening here? 
An extremely powerful dynamic that has huge commercial and cultural implications is at play. 
Namely, that technology is enabling trust between strangers. 
We now live in a global village where we can mimic the ties that used to happen face to face, but on a scale and in ways that have never been possible before. 
So what's actually happening is that social networks and real-time technologies are taking us back. 
We're bartering, trading, swapping, sharing, but they're being reinvented into dynamic and appealing forms. 
What I find fascinating is that we've actually wired our world to share, whether that's our neighborhood, our school, our office, or our Facebook network, and that's creating an economy of "what's mine is yours." 
From the mighty eBay, the grandfather of exchange marketplaces, to car-sharing companies such as GoGet, where you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour, to social lending platforms such as Zopa, that will take anyone in this audience with 100 dollars to lend, and match them with a borrower anywhere in the world, we're sharing and collaborating again in ways that I believe are more hip than hippie. 
I call this "groundswell collaborative consumption." 
Now before I dig into the different systems of collaborative consumption, I'd like to try and answer the question that every author rightfully gets asked, which is, where did this idea come from? 
Now I'd like to say I woke up one morning and said, "I'm going to write about collaborative consumption," but actually it was a complicated web of seemingly disconnected ideas. 
Over the next minute, you're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display of all the dots that went on in my head. 
The first thing I began to notice: how many big concepts were emerging -- from the wisdom of crowds to smart mobs -- around how ridiculously easy it is to form groups for a purpose. 
And linked to this crowd mania were examples all around the world -- from the election of a president to the infamous Wikipedia, and everything in between -- on what the power of numbers could achieve. 
Now, you know when you learn a new word, and then you start to see that word everywhere? 
That's what happened to me when I noticed that we are moving from passive consumers to creators, to highly enabled collaborators. 
What's happening is the Internet is removing the middleman, so that anyone from a T-shirt designer to a knitter can make a living selling peer-to-peer. 
And the ubiquitous force of this peer-to-peer revolution means that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates. 
I mean, it's amazing to think that, in every single minute of this speech, 25 hours of YouTube video will be loaded. 
Now what I find fascinating about these examples is how they're actually tapping into our primate instincts. 
I mean, we're monkeys, and we're born and bred to share and cooperate. 
And we were doing so for thousands of years, whether it's when we hunted in packs, or farmed in cooperatives, before this big system called hyper-consumption came along and we built these fences and created out own little fiefdoms. 
But things are changing, and one of the reasons why is the digital natives, or Gen-Y. 
They're growing up sharing -- files, video games, knowledge. 
It's second nature to them. 
So we, the millennials -- I am just a millennial -- are like foot soldiers, moving us from a culture of "me" to a culture of "we." 
The reason why it's happening so fast is because of mobile collaboration. 
We now live in a connected age where we can locate anyone, anytime, in real-time, from a small device in our hands. 
All of this was going through my head towards the end of 2008, when, of course, the great financial crash happened. 
Thomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists, and he poignantly commented that 2008 is when we hit a wall, when Mother Nature and the market both said, "No more." 
Now we rationally know that an economy built on hyper-consumption is a Ponzi scheme. It's a house of cards. 
Yet, it's hard for us to individually know what to do. 
So all of this is a lot of twittering, right? 
Well it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head, until actually I realized it was happening because of four key drivers. 
One, a renewed belief in the importance of community, and a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means. 
A torrent of peer-to-peer social networks and real-time technologies, fundamentally changing the way we behave. 
Three, pressing unresolved environmental concerns. 
And four, a global recession that has fundamentally shocked consumer behaviors. 
These four drivers are fusing together and creating the big shift -- away from the 20th century, defined by hyper-consumption, towards the 21st century, defined by collaborative consumption. 
I generally believe we're at an inflection point where the sharing behaviors -- through sites such as Flickr and Twitter that are becoming second nature online -- are being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives. 
From morning commutes to the way fashion is designed to the way we grow food, we are consuming and collaborating once again. 
So my co-author, Roo Rogers, and I have actually gathered thousands of examples from all around the world of collaborative consumption. 
And although they vary enormously in scale, maturity and purpose, when we dived into them, we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems. 
The first is redistribution markets. 
Redistribution markets, just like Swaptree, are when you take a used, or pre-owned, item and move it from where it's not needed to somewhere, or someone, where it is. 
They're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'R' -- reduce, reuse, recycle, repair and redistribute -- because they stretch the life cycle of a product and thereby reduce waste. 
The second is collaborative lifestyles. 
This is the sharing of resources of things like money, skills and time. 
I bet, in a couple of years, that phrases like "coworking" and "couchsurfing" and "time banks" are going to become a part of everyday vernacular. 
One of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles is called Landshare. 
It's a scheme in the U.K. 
that matches Mr. Jones, with some spare space in his back garden, with Mrs. Smith, a would-be grower. 
Together they grow their own food. 
It's one of those ideas that's so simple, yet brilliant, you wonder why it's never been done before. 
Now, the third system is product-service systems. 
This is where you pay for the benefit of the product -- what it does for you -- without needing to own the product outright. 
This idea is particularly powerful for things that have high-idling capacity. 
And that can be anything from baby goods to fashions to -- how many of you have a power drill, own a power drill? Right. 
That power drill will be used around 12 to 13 minutes in its entire lifetime. 
(Laughter) It's kind of ridiculous, right? 
Because what you need is the hole, not the drill. 
(Laughter) (Applause) So why don't you rent the drill, or, even better, rent out your own drill to other people and make some money from it? 
These three systems are coming together, allowing people to share resources without sacrificing their lifestyles, or their cherished personal freedoms. 
I'm not asking people to share nicely in the sandpit. 
So I want to just give you an example of how powerful collaborative consumption can be to change behaviors. 
The average car costs 8,000 dollars a year to run. 
Yet, that car sits idle for 23 hours a day. 
So when you consider these two facts, it starts to make a little less sense that we have to own one outright. 
So this is where car-sharing companies such as Zipcar and GoGet come in. 
In 2009, Zipcar took 250 participants from across 13 cities -- and they're all self-confessed car addicts and car-sharing rookies -- and got them to surrender their keys for a month. 
Instead, these people had to walk, bike, take the train, or other forms of public transport. 
They could only use their Zipcar membership when absolutely necessary. 
The results of this challenge after just one month was staggering. 
It's amazing that 413 lbs were lost just from the extra exercise. 
But my favorite statistic is that 100 out of the 250 participants did not want their keys back. 
In other words, the car addicts had lost their urge to own. 
Now products-service systems have been around for years. 
Just think of libraries and laundrettes. 
But I think they're entering a new age, because technology makes sharing frictionless and fun. 
There's a great quote that was written in the New York Times that said, "Sharing is to ownership what the iPod is to the 8-track, what solar power is to the coal mine." 
I believe also, our generation, our relationship to satisfying what we want is far less tangible than any other previous generation. 
I don't want the DVD; I want the movie it carries. 
I don't want a clunky answering machine; I want the message it saves. 
I don't want a CD; I want the music it plays. 
In other words, I don't want stuff; I want the needs or experiences it fulfills. 
This is fueling a massive shift from where usage trumps possessions -- or as Kevin Kelly, the editor of Wired magazine, puts it, "where access is better than ownership." 
Now as our possessions dematerialize into the cloud, a blurry line is appearing between what's mine, what's yours, and what's ours. 
I want to give you one example that shows how fast this evolution is happening. 
This represents an eight-year time span. 
We've gone from traditional car-ownership to car-sharing companies, such as Zipcar and GoGet, to ride-sharing platforms that match rides to the newest entry, which is peer-to-peer car rental, where you can actually make money out of renting that car that sits idle for 23 hours a day to your neighbor. 
Now all of these systems require a degree of trust, and the cornerstone to this working is reputation. 
Now in the old consumer system, our reputation didn't matter so much, because our credit history was far more important that any kind of peer-to-peer review. 
But now with the Web, we leave a trail. 
With every spammer we flag, with every idea we post, comment we share, we're actually signaling how well we collaborate, and whether we can or can't be trusted. 
Let's go back to my first example, Swaptree. 
I can see that Rondoron has completed 553 trades with a 100 percent success rate. 
In other words, I can trust him or her. 
Now mark my words, it's only a matter of time before we're going to be able to perform a Google-like search and see a cumulative picture of our reputation capital. 
And this reputation capital will determine our access to collaborative consumption. 
It's a new social currency, so to speak, that could become as powerful as our credit rating. 
Now as a closing thought, I believe we're actually in a period where we're waking up from this humongous hangover of emptiness and waste, and we're taking a leap to create a more sustainable system built to serve our innate needs for community and individual identity. 
I believe it will be referred to as a revolution, so to speak -- when society, faced with great challenges, made a seismic shift from individual getting and spending towards a rediscovery of collective good. 
I'm on a mission to make sharing cool. 
I'm on a mission to make sharing hip. 
Because I really believe it can disrupt outdated modes of business, help us leapfrog over wasteful forms of hyper-consumption and teach us when enough really is enough. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

On a warm August morning in Harare, Farai, a 24-year-old mother of two, walks towards a park bench. 
She looks miserable and dejected. 
Now, on the park bench sits an 82-year-old woman, better known to the community as Grandmother Jack. 
Farai hands Grandmother Jack an envelope from the clinic nurse. 
Grandmother Jack invites Farai to sit down as she opens the envelope and reads. 
There's silence for three minutes or so as she reads. 
And after a long pause, Grandmother Jack takes a deep breath, looks at Farai and says, "I'm here for you. 
Would you like to share your story with me?" 
Farai begins, her eyes swelling with tears. 
She says, "Grandmother Jack, I'm HIV-positive. 
I've been living with HIV for the past four years. 
My husband left me a year ago. 
I have two kids under the age of five. 
I'm unemployed. 
I can hardly take care of my children." 
Tears are now flowing down her face. 
And in response, Grandmother Jack moves closer, puts her hand on Farai, and says, "Farai, it's OK to cry. 
You've been through a lot. 
Would you like to share more with me?" 
And Farai continues. 
"In the last three weeks, I have had recurrent thoughts of killing myself, taking my two children with me. 
I can't take it anymore. 
The clinic nurse sent me to see you." 
There's an exchange between the two, which lasts about 30 minutes. 
And finally, Grandmother Jack says, "Farai, it seems to me that you have all the symptoms of kufungisisa." 
The word "kufungisisa" opens up a floodgate of tears. 
So, kufungisisa is the local equivalent of depression in my country. 
It literally means "thinking too much." 
The World Health Organization estimates that more than 300 million people globally, today, suffer from depression, or what in my country we call kufungisisa. 
And the World Health Organization also tells us that every 40 seconds, someone somewhere in the world commits suicide because they are unhappy, largely due to depression or kufungisisa. 
And most of these deaths are occurring in low- and middle-income countries. 
In fact, the World Health Organization goes as far as to say that when you look at the age group between 15 to 29, a leading cause of death now is actually suicide. 
But there are wider events that lead to depression and in some cases, suicide, such as abuse, conflict, violence, isolation, loneliness -- the list is endless. 
But one thing that we do know is that depression can be treated and suicides averted. 
But the problem is we just don't have enough psychiatrists or psychologists in the world to do the job. 
In most low- and middle-income countries, for instance, the ratio of psychiatrists to the population is something like one for every one and a half million people, which literally means that 90 percent of the people needing mental health services will not get it. 
In my country, there are 12 psychiatrists, and I'm one of them, for a population of approximately 14 million. 
Now, let me just put that into context. 
One evening while I was at home, I get a call from the ER, or the emergency room, from a city which is some 200 kilometers away from where I live. 
And the ER doctor says, "One of your patients, someone you treated four months ago, has just taken an overdose, and they are in the ER department. 
Hemodynamically, they seem to be OK, but they will need neuropsychiatric evaluation." 
Now, I obviously can't get into my car in the middle of the night and drive 200 kilometers. 
So as best as we could, over the phone with the ER doctor, we come up with an assessment. 
We ensure that suicidal observations are in place. 
We ensure that we start reviewing the antidepressants that this patient has been taking, and we finally conclude that as soon as Erica -- that was her name, 26-year-old -- as soon as Erica is ready to be released from the ER, she should come directly to me with her mother, and I will evaluate and establish what can be done. 
And we assumed that that would take about a week. 
A week passes. 
Three weeks pass. 
No Erica. 
And one day I get a call from Erica's mother, and she says, "Erica committed suicide three days ago. 
She hanged herself from the mango tree in the family garden." 
Now, almost like a knee-jerk reaction, I couldn't help but ask, "But why didn't you come to Harare, where I live? 
We had agreed that as soon as you're released from the ER, you will come to me." 
Her response was brief. 
"We didn't have the 15 dollars bus fare to come to Harare." 
Now, suicide is not an unusual event in the world of mental health. 
But there was something about Erica's death that struck me at the core of my very being. 
That statement from Erica's mother: "We didn't have 15 dollars bus fare to come to you," made me realize that it just wasn't going to work, me expecting people to come to me. 
And I got into this state of soul-searching, trying to really discover my role as a psychiatrist in Africa. 
And after considerable consultation and soul-searching, talking to colleagues, friends and family, it suddenly dawned on me that actually, one the most reliable resources we have in Africa are grandmothers. 
Yes, grandmothers. 
And I thought, grandmothers are in every community. 
There are hundreds of them. 
And -- (Laughter) And they don't leave their communities in search of greener pastures. 
(Laughter) See, the only time they leave is when they go to a greener pasture called heaven. 
(Laughter) So I thought, how about training grandmothers in evidence-based talk therapy, which they can deliver on a bench? 
Empower them with the skills to listen, to show empathy, all of that rooted in cognitive behavioral therapy; empower them with the skills to provide behavior activation, activity scheduling; and support them using digital technology. 
You know, mobile phone technology. 
Pretty much everyone in Africa has a mobile phone today. 
So in 2006, I started my first group of grandmothers. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) Today, there are hundreds of grandmothers who are working in more than 70 communities. 
And in the last year alone, more than 30,000 people received treatment on the Friendship Bench from a grandmother in a community in Zimbabwe. 
(Applause) And recently, we published this work that is done by these grandmothers in the Journal of the American Medical Association. 
And -- (Applause) And our results show that six months after receiving treatment from a grandmother, people were still symptom-free: no depression, suicidal ideation completely reduced. 
In fact, our results -- this was a clinical trial -- in fact, this clinical trial showed that grandmothers were more effective at treating depression than doctors and -- (Laughter) (Applause) And so, we're now working towards expanding this program. 
There are more than 600 million people currently aged above 65 in the world. 
And by the year 2050, there will be 1.5 billion people aged 65 and above. 
Imagine if we could create a global network of grandmothers in every major city in the world, who are trained in evidence-based talk therapy, supported through digital platforms, networked. 
And they will make a difference in communities. 
They will reduce the treatment gap for mental, neurological and substance-use disorders. 
Finally, this is a file photograph of Grandmother Jack. 
So, Farai had six sessions on the bench with Grandmother Jack. 
Today, Farai is employed. 
She has her two children at school. 
And as for Grandmother Jack, one morning in February, we expected her to see her 257th client on the bench. 
She didn't show up. 
She had gone to a greener pasture called heaven. 
But I believe that Grandmother Jack, from up there, she's cheering on all the other grandmothers -- the increasing number of grandmothers who are making a difference in the lives of thousands of people. 
And I'm sure she's in awe when she realizes that something that she helped to pioneer is now spreading to other countries, like Malawi, the island of Zanzibar and coming closer to home here in the Unites States in the city of New York. 
May her soul rest in peace. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) (Cheering) (Applause) 

Currently, most refugees live in the cities rather than in the refugee camps. 
We represent over 60 percent of the number of refugees globally. 
With the majority of refugees living in urban areas, there is a strong need for a paradigm shift and new thinking. 
Rather than wasting money on building walls, it would be better to spend on programs to help refugees to help themselves. 
(Applause) We always have to leave behind all our possessions. 
But not our skills and knowledge. 
If allowed to live a productive life, refugees can help themselves and contribute to the development of their host country. 
I was born in the city called Bukavu, South Kivu, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
I am the fifth-born in a family of 12 children. 
My father, a mechanic by profession, worked very hard to send me to school. 
Just like other young people, I had a lot of plans and dreams. 
I wanted to complete my studies, get a nice job, marry and have my own children and support my family. 
But this didn't happen. 
War in my homeland forced me to flee to Uganda in 2008, nine years ago. 
My family joined a steady exodus of refugees who settled in Uganda's capital, Kampala. 
In my country, I lived already in the city, and we felt Kampala was much better than a refugee camp. 
Refugees in the cities have always been denied international assistance, even after their recognition by UNHCR in 1997. 
In addition to the poverty problem we were confronted with as the local urban poor, we were facing challenges due to our refugee status, such as a language barrier. 
In Congo, the official language is French. 
But in Uganda, it is English. 
We didn't have access to education and health. 
We were exposed to harassment, exploitation, intimidation and discrimination. 
Humanitarian organizations mostly focused on the formal settlement in rural areas, and there was nothing in place for us. 
But we didn't want handouts. 
We wanted to work and support ourselves. 
I joined my other two colleagues in exile and set up an organization to support other refugees. 
YARID -- Young African Refugees for Integral Development -- began as a conversation within the Congolese community. 
We asked the community how they could organize themselves to solve these challenges. 
The YARID programs for support evolve in stages, progressing from soccer community, to English language to sewing livelihoods. 
The soccer changed the energy of unemployed youth and connected people from different communities. 
The free English classes help empower people to engage with the Ugandan community, allowing them to get to know their neighbors and sell wares. 
The vocational training program offers livelihood skills, and with them, important opportunities for economic self-reliance. 
We've seen so many families become self-sustaining. 
We've seen who no longer needs our help. 
As YARID's programs have expanded, it has included an increasing range of nationalities -- Congolese, Rwandan, Burundian, Somalis, Ethiopian, South Sudanese. 
Today, YARID has supported over 3,000 refugees across Kampala and continues supporting more. 
(Applause) Refugees want empowerment, not handouts. 
We know our community better than anyone. 
We understand the challenges and opportunities we face to become self-reliant. 
I know better than anyone that initiatives created by refugees work. 
They need to be internationally recognized and supported. 
Give us the support we deserve, and we will pay you back with interest. 
Thank you so much. 
(Applause) 

Beverly Joubert: We are truly passionate about the African wilderness and protecting the African wilderness, and so what we've done is we've focused on iconic cats. 
And I know, in the light of human suffering and poverty and even climate change, one would wonder, why worry about a few cats? 
Well today we're here to share with you a message that we have learned from a very important and special character -- this leopard. 
Dereck Joubert: Well, our lives have basically been like a super long episode of "CSI" -- something like 28 years. 
In essence, what we've done is we've studied the science, we've looked at the behavior, we've seen over 2,000 kills by these amazing animals. 
But one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality, that individual personality that these animals have. 
And here's a prime example. 
We found this leopard in a 2,000-year-old baobab tree in Africa, the same tree that we found her mother in and her grandmother. 
And she took us on a journey and revealed something very special to us -- her own daughter, eight days old. 
And the minute we found this leopard, we realized that we needed to move in, and so we basically stayed with this leopard for the next four-and-a-half years -- following her every day, getting to know her, that individual personality of hers, and really coming to know her. 
Now I'm destined to spend a lot of time with some unique, very, very special, individualistic and often seductive female characters. 
(Laughter) Beverly's clearly one of them, and this little leopard, Legadema, is another, and she changed our lives. 
BJ: Well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her -- in fact, more time than even her mother did. 
When her mother would go off hunting, we would stay and film. 
And early on, a lightning bolt hit a tree 20 paces away from us. 
It was frightening, and it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell. 
And of course, we were stunned for a while, but when we managed to get our wits about us, we looked at it and said, "My gosh, what's going to happen with that little cub? 
She's probably going to forever associate that deafening crash with us." 
Well, we needn't have worried. 
She came charging out of the thicket straight towards us, sat next to us, shivering, with her back towards Dereck, and looking out. 
And actually from that day on, she's been comfortable with us. 
So we felt that that day was the day that she really earned her name. 
We called her Legadema, which means, "light from the sky." 
DJ: Now we've found these individualisms in all sorts of animals, in particular in the cats. 
This particular one is called Eetwidomayloh, "he who greets with fire," and you can just see that about him, you know -- that's his character. 
But only by getting up close to these animals and spending time with them can we actually even reach out and dig out these personal characters that they have. 
BJ: But through our investigation, we have to seek the wildest places in Africa. 
And right now this is in the Okavango Delta in Botswana. 
Yes, it is swamp. We live in the swamp in a tent, but I must tell you, every day is exhilarating. 
But also, our hearts are in our throats a huge amount of the time, because we're driving through water, and it's an unknown territory. 
But we're really there seeking and searching and filming the iconic cats. 
DJ: Now one of the big things, of course, everybody knows that cats hate water, and so this was a real revelation for us. 
And we could only find this by pushing ourselves, by going where no sane person should go -- not without some prompting, by the way, from Beverly -- and just pushing the envelope, going out there, pushing our vehicle, pushing ourselves. 
But we've managed to find that these lions are 15 percent bigger than any others, and they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water. 
BJ: And then of course, the challenge is knowing when to turn around. 
We don't always get that right, and on this particular day, we seriously underestimated the depth. 
We got deeper and deeper, until it was at Dereck's chest-height. 
Well then we hit a deep depression, and we seriously submerged the vehicle. 
We actually managed to drown two million dollars' worth of camera gear. 
We drowned our pride, I must tell you, which was really serious, and we seized the engine. 
DJ: And of course, one of the rules that we have in the vehicle is that he who drowns the vehicle gets to swim with the crocodiles. 
(Laughter) You will notice also that all of these images here are taken from the top angle by Beverly -- the dry top angle, by the way. 
(Laughter) But all the places we get stuck in really have great views. 
And it wasn't a moment, and these lions came back towards us, and Beverly was able to get a great photograph. 
BJ: But we truly do spend day and night trying to capture unique footage. 
And 20 years ago, we did a film called "Eternal Enemies" where we managed to capture this unusual disturbing behavior across two species -- lions and hyenas. 
And surprisingly, it became a cult film. 
And we can only work that out as people were seeing parallels between the thuggish side of nature and gang warfare. 
DJ: It was amazing, because you can see that this lion is doing exactly what his name, Eetwidomayloh, represents. 
He's focused on this hyena, and he is going to get it. 
(Animal sounds) But that's, I think, what this is all about, is that these individuals have these personalities and characters. 
But for us to get them, not only do we push ourselves, but we live by certain rules of engagement, which mean we can't interfere. 
This sort of behavior has been going on for three, four, five million years, and we can't step in and say, "That's wrong, and that's right." 
But that's not always easy for us. 
BJ: So, as Dereck says, we have to work through extremes -- extreme temperatures, push ourselves at night. 
Sleep deprivation is extreme. 
We're on the edge through a large part of the time. 
But, for 10 years, we tried to capture lions and elephants together -- and never ever managed until this particular night. 
And I have to tell you that it was a disturbing night for me. 
I had tears rolling down my cheeks. 
I was shaking with anxiety, but I knew that [I had] to capture something that had never been seen before, had never been documented. 
And I do believe you should stay with us. 
DJ: The amazing thing about these moments -- and this is probably a highlight of our career -- is that you never know how it's going to end. 
Many people believe, in fact, that death begins in the eyes, not in the heart, not in the lungs, and that's when people give up hope, or when any life form gives up hope. 
And you can see the start of it here. 
This elephant, against overwhelming odds, simply gives up hope. 
But by the same token, you can get your hope back again. 
So just when you think it's all over, something else happens, some spark gets into you, some sort of will to fight -- that iron will that we all have, that this elephant has, that conservation has, that big cats have. 
Everything has that will to survive, to fight, to push through that mental barrier and to keep going. 
And for us, in many ways, this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration for us, a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work. 
(Applause) Now back to the leopard. 
We were spending so much time with this leopard and getting to understand her individualism, her personal character, that maybe we were taking it a little bit far. 
We were perhaps taking her for granted, and maybe she didn't like that that much. 
This is about couples working together, and so I do need to say that within the vehicle we have quite strict territories, Beverly and I. 
Beverly sits on the one side where all her camera gear is, and I'm on the other side where my space is. 
These are precious to us, these divides. 
BJ: But when this little cub saw that I had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear, she came in like a curious cat to come and investigate. 
It was phenomenal, and we felt grateful that she trusted us to that extent. 
But at the same time, we were concerned that if she created this as a habit and jumped into somebody else's car, it might not turn out the same way -- she might get shot for that. 
So we knew we had to react quickly. 
And the only way we thought we could without scaring her is to try and simulate a growl like her mother would make -- a hiss and a sound. 
So Dereck turned on the heater fan in the car -- very innovative. 
DJ: It was the only way for me to save the marriage, because Beverly felt she was being replaced, you see. 
(Laughter) But really and truly, this was how this little leopard was displaying her individual personality. 
But nothing prepared us for what happened next in our relationship with her, when she started hunting. 
BJ: And on this first hunt, we truly were excited. 
It was like watching a graduation ceremony. 
We felt like we were surrogate parents. 
And of course, we knew now that she was going to survive. 
But only when we saw the tiny baby baboon clinging to the mother's fur did we realize that something very unique was taking place here with Legadema. 
And of course, the baby baboon was so innocent, it didn't turn and run. 
So what we watched over the next couple of hours was very unique. 
It was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety, protecting it from the hyena. 
And over the next five hours, she took care of it. 
We realized that we actually don't know everything, and that nature is so unpredictable, we have to be open at all times. 
DJ: Okay, so she was a little bit rough. 
(Laughter) But in fact, what we were seeing here was interesting. 
Because she is a cub wanting to play, but she was also a predator needing to kill, and yet conflicted in some way, because she was also an emerging mother. 
She had this maternal instinct, much like a young girl on her way to womanhood, and so this really took us to this new level of understanding that personality. 
BJ: And of course, through the night, they lay together. 
They ended up sleeping for hours. 
But I have to tell you -- everybody always asks, "What happened to the baby baboon?" 
It did die, and we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights. 
DJ: So at this stage, I guess, we had very, very firm ideas on what conservation meant. 
We had to deal with these individual personalities. 
We had to deal with them with respect and celebrate them. 
And so we, with the National Geographic, formed the Big Cats Initiative to march forward into conservation, taking care of the big cats that we loved -- and then had an opportunity to look back over the last 50 years to see how well we had all collectively been doing. 
So when Beverly and I were born, there were 450,000 lions, and today there are 20,000. 
Tigers haven't fared any better -- 45,000 down to maybe 3,000. 
BJ: And then cheetahs have crashed all the way down to 12,000. 
Leopards have plummeted from 700,000 down to a mere 50,000. 
Now in the extraordinary time that we have worked with Legadema -- which is really over a five-year period -- 10,000 leopards were legally shot by safari hunters. 
And that's not the only leopards that were being killed through that period. 
There's an immense amount of poaching as well, and so possibly the same amount. 
It's simply not sustainable. 
We admire them, and we fear them, and yet, as man, we want to steal their power. 
It used to be the time where only kings wore a leopard skin, but now throughout rituals and ceremonies, traditional healers and ministers. 
And of course, looking at this lion paw that has been skinned, it eerily reminds me of a human hand, and that's ironic, because their fate is in our hands. 
DJ: There's a burgeoning bone trade. 
South Africa just released some lion bones onto the market. 
Lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same, and so in a stroke, the lion bone industry is going to wipe out all the tigers. 
So we have a real problem here, no more so than the lions do, the male lions. 
So the 20,000 lion figure that you just saw is actually a red herring, because there may be 3,000 or 4,000 male lions, and they all are actually infected with the same disease. 
I call it complacency -- our complacency. 
Because there's a sport, there's an activity going on that we're all aware of, that we condone. 
And that's probably because we haven't seen it like we are today. 
BJ: And you have to know that, when a male lion is killed, it completely disrupts the whole pride. 
A new male comes into the area and takes over the pride, and, of course, first of all kills all the cubs and possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs. 
So we've estimated that between 20 [and] 30 lions are killed when one lion is hanging on a wall somewhere in a far-off place. 
DJ: So what our investigations have shown is that these lions are essential. 
They're essential to the habitat. 
If they disappear, whole ecosystems in Africa disappear. 
There's an 80-billion-dollar-a-year ecotourism revenue stream into Africa. 
So this is not just a concern about lions; it's a concern about communities in Africa as well. 
If they disappear, all of that goes away. 
But what I'm more concerned about in many ways is that, as we de-link ourselves from nature, as we de-link ourselves spiritually from these animals, we lose hope, we lose that spiritual connection, our dignity, that thing within us that keeps us connected to the planet. 
BJ: So you have to know, looking into the eyes of lions and leopards right now, it is all about critical awareness. 
And so what we are doing, in February, we're bringing out a film called "The Last Lion," and "The Last Lion" is exactly what is happening right now. 
That is the situation we're in -- the last lions. 
That is, if we don't take action and do something, these plains will be completely devoid of big cats, and then, in turn, everything else will disappear. 
And simply, if we can't protect them, we're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well. 
DJ: And in fact, that original thing that we spoke about and designed our lives by -- that conservation was all about respect and celebration -- is probably true. That's really what it needs. 
We need it. We respect and celebrate each other as a man and a woman, as a community and as part of this planet, and we need to continue that. 
And Legadema? 
Well we can report, in fact, that we're grandparents. 
(Laughter) BJ/DJ: Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

In 1962, with Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring," I think for people like me in the world of the making of things, the canary in the mine wasn't singing. 
And so the question that we might not have birds became kind of fundamental to those of us wandering around looking for the meadowlarks that seemed to have all disappeared. 
And the question was, were the birds singing? 
Now, I'm not a scientist, that'll be really clear. 
But, you know, we've just come from this discussion of what a bird might be. 
What is a bird? 
Well, in my world, this is a rubber duck. 
It comes in California with a warning -- "This product contains chemicals known by the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm." 
This is a bird. 
What kind of culture would produce a product of this kind and then label it and sell it to children? 
I think we have a design problem. 
Someone heard the six hours of talk that I gave called "The Monticello Dialogues" on NPR, and sent me this as a thank you note -- "We realize that design is a signal of intention, but it also has to occur within a world, and we have to understand that world in order to imbue our designs with inherent intelligence, and so as we look back at the basic state of affairs in which we design, we, in a way, need to go to the primordial condition to understand the operating system and the frame conditions of a planet, and I think the exciting part of that is the good news that's there, because the news is the news of abundance, and not the news of limits, and I think as our culture tortures itself now with tyrannies and concerns over limits and fear, we can add this other dimension of abundance that is coherent, driven by the sun, and start to imagine what that would be like to share." 
That was a nice thing to get. 
That was one sentence. 
Henry James would be proud. 
This is -- I put it down at the bottom, but that was extemporaneous, obviously. 
The fundamental issue is that, for me, design is the first signal of human intentions. 
So what are our intentions, and what would our intentions be -- if we wake up in the morning, we have designs on the world -- well, what would our intention be as a species now that we're the dominant species? 
And it's not just stewardship and dominion debate, because really, dominion is implicit in stewardship -- because how could you dominate something you had killed? 
And stewardship's implicit in dominion, because you can't be steward of something if you can't dominate it. 
So the question is, what is the first question for designers? 
Now, as guardians -- let's say the state, for example, which reserves the right to kill, the right to be duplicitous and so on -- the question we're asking the guardian at this point is are we meant, how are we meant, to secure local societies, create world peace and save the environment? 
But I don't know that that's the common debate. 
Commerce, on the other hand, is relatively quick, essentially creative, highly effective and efficient, and fundamentally honest, because we can't exchange value for very long if we don't trust each other. 
So we use the tools of commerce primarily for our work, but the question we bring to it is, how do we love all the children of all species for all time? 
And so we start our designs with that question. 
Because what we realize today is that modern culture appears to have adopted a strategy of tragedy. 
If we come here and say, "Well, I didn't intend to cause global warming on the way here," and we say, "That's not part of my plan," then we realize it's part of our de facto plan. 
Because it's the thing that's happening because we have no other plan. 
And I was at the White House for President Bush, meeting with every federal department and agency, and I pointed out that they appear to have no plan. 
If the end game is global warming, they're doing great. 
If the end game is mercury toxification of our children downwind of coal fire plants as they scuttled the Clean Air Act, then I see that our education programs should be explicitly defined as, "Brain death for all children. No child left behind." 
(Applause) So, the question is, how many federal officials are ready to move to Ohio and Pennsylvania with their families? 
So if you don't have an endgame of something delightful, then you're just moving chess pieces around, if you don't know you're taking the king. 
So perhaps we could develop a strategy of change, which requires humility. And in my business as an architect, it's unfortunate the word "humility" and the word "architect" have not appeared in the same paragraph since "The Fountainhead." 
So if anybody here has trouble with the concept of design humility, reflect on this -- it took us 5,000 years to put wheels on our luggage. 
So, as Kevin Kelly pointed out, there is no endgame. 
There is an infinite game, and we're playing in that infinite game. 
And so we call it "cradle to cradle," and our goal is very simple. 
This is what I presented to the White House. 
Our goal is a delightfully diverse, safe, healthy and just world, with clean air, clean water, soil and power -- economically, equitably, ecologically and elegantly enjoyed, period. 
(Applause) What don't you like about this? 
Which part of this don't you like? 
So we realized we want full diversity, even though it can be difficult to remember what De Gaulle said when asked what it was like to be President of France. 
He said, "What do you think it's like trying to run a country with 400 kinds of cheese?" 
But at the same time, we realize that our products are not safe and healthy. 
So we've designed products and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million. 
This is a baby blanket by Pendleton that will give your child nutrition instead of Alzheimer's later in life. 
We can ask ourselves, what is justice, and is justice blind, or is justice blindness? 
And at what point did that uniform turn from white to black? 
Water has been declared a human right by the United Nations. 
Air quality is an obvious thing to anyone who breathes. 
Is there anybody here who doesn't breathe? 
Clean soil is a critical problem -- the nitrification, the dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico. 
A fundamental issue that's not being addressed. 
We've seen the first form of solar energy that's beat the hegemony of fossil fuels in the form of wind here in the Great Plains, and so that hegemony is leaving. 
And if we remember Sheikh Yamani when he formed OPEC, they asked him, "When will we see the end of the age of oil?" 
I don't know if you remember his answer, but it was, "The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones." 
We see that companies acting ethically in this world are outperforming those that don't. 
We see the flows of materials in a rather terrifying prospect. 
This is a hospital monitor from Los Angeles, sent to China. 
This woman will expose herself to toxic phosphorous, release four pounds of toxic lead into her childrens' environment, which is from copper. 
On the other hand, we see great signs of hope. 
Here's Dr. Venkataswamy in India, who's figured out how to do mass-produced health. 
He has given eyesight to two million people for free. 
We see in our material flows that car steels don't become car steel again because of the contaminants of the coatings -- bismuth, antimony, copper and so on. 
They become building steel. 
On the other hand, we're working with Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett and Shaw Carpet, the largest carpet company in the world. 
We've developed a carpet that is continuously recyclable, down to the parts per million. 
The upper is Nylon 6 that can go back to caprolactam, the bottom, a polyolephine -- infinitely recyclable thermoplastic. 
Now if I was a bird, the building on my left is a liability. 
The building on my right, which is our corporate campus for The Gap with an ancient meadow, is an asset -- its nesting grounds. 
Here's where I come from. I grew up in Hong Kong, with six million people in 40 square miles. 
During the dry season, we had four hours of water every fourth day. 
And the relationship to landscape was that of farmers who have been farming the same piece of ground for 40 centuries. 
You can't farm the same piece of ground for 40 centuries without understanding nutrient flow. 
My childhood summers were in the Puget Sound of Washington, among the first growth and big growth. 
My grandfather had been a lumberjack in the Olympics, so I have a lot of tree karma I am working off. 
I went to Yale for graduate school, studied in a building of this style by Le Corbusier, affectionately known in our business as Brutalism. 
If we look at the world of architecture, we see with Mies' 1928 tower for Berlin, the question might be, "Well, where's the sun?" 
And this might have worked in Berlin, but we built it in Houston, and the windows are all closed. And with most products appearing not to have been designed for indoor use, this is actually a vertical gas chamber. 
When I went to Yale, we had the first energy crisis, and I was designing the first solar-heated house in Ireland as a student, which I then built -- which would give you a sense of my ambition. 
And Richard Meier, who was one of my teachers, kept coming over to my desk to give me criticism, and he would say, "Bill, you've got to understand- -- solar energy has nothing to do with architecture." 
I guess he didn't read Vitruvius. 
In 1984, we did the first so-called "green office" in America for Environmental Defense. 
We started asking manufacturers what were in their materials. 
They said, "They're proprietary, they're legal, go away." 
The only indoor quality work done in this country at that time was sponsored by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, and it was to prove there was no danger from secondhand smoke in the workplace. 
So, all of a sudden, here I am, graduating from high school in 1969, and this happens, and we realize that "away" went away. 
Remember we used to throw things away, and we'd point to away? 
And yet, NOAA has now shown us, for example -- you see that little blue thing above Hawaii? 
That's the Pacific Gyre. 
It was recently dragged for plankton by scientists, and they found six times as much plastic as plankton. 
When asked, they said, "It's kind of like a giant toilet that doesn't flush." 
Perhaps that's away. 
So we're looking for the design rules of this -- this is the highest biodiversity of trees in the world, Irian Jaya, 259 species of tree, and we described this in the book, "Cradle to Cradle." 
The book itself is a polymer. It is not a tree. 
That's the name of the first chapter -- "This Book is Not a Tree." 
Because in poetics, as Margaret Atwood pointed out, "we write our history on the skin of fish with the blood of bears." 
And with so much polymer, what we really need is technical nutrition, and to use something as elegant as a tree -- imagine this design assignment: Design something that makes oxygen, sequesters carbon, fixes nitrogen, distills water, accrues solar energy as fuel, makes complex sugars and food, creates microclimates, changes colors with the seasons and self-replicates. 
Well, why don't we knock that down and write on it? 
(Laughter) So, we're looking at the same criteria as most people -- you know, can I afford it? 
Does it work? Do I like it? 
We're adding the Jeffersonian agenda, and I come from Charlottesville, where I've had the privilege of living in a house designed by Thomas Jefferson. 
We're adding life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
Now if we look at the word "competition," I'm sure most of you've used it. 
You know, most people don't realize it comes from the Latin competere, which means strive together. 
It means the way Olympic athletes train with each other. 
They get fit together, and then they compete. 
The Williams sisters compete -- one wins Wimbledon. 
So we've been looking at the idea of competition as a way of cooperating in order to get fit together. 
And the Chinese government has now -- I work with the Chinese government now -- has taken this up. 
We're also looking at survival of the fittest, not in just competition terms in our modern context of destroy the other or beat them to the ground, but really to fit together and build niches and have growth that is good. 
Now most environmentalists don't say growth is good, because, in our lexicon, asphalt is two words: assigning blame. 
But if we look at asphalt as our growth, then we realize that all we're doing is destroying the planetary's fundamental underlying operating system. 
So when we see E equals mc squared come along, from a poet's perspective, we see energy as physics, chemistry as mass, and all of a sudden, you get this biology. 
And we have plenty of energy, so we'll solve that problem, but the biology problem's tricky, because as we put through all these toxic materials that we disgorge, we will never be able to recover that. 
And as Francis Crick pointed out, nine years after discovering DNA with Mr. Watson, that life itself has to have growth as a precondition -- it has to have free energy, sunlight and it needs to be an open system of chemicals. 
So we're asking for human artifice to become a living thing, and we want growth, we want free energy from sunlight and we want an open metabolism for chemicals. 
Then, the question becomes not growth or no growth, but what do you want to grow? 
So instead of just growing destruction, we want to grow the things that we might enjoy, and someday the FDA will allow us to make French cheese. 
So therefore, we have these two metabolisms, and I worked with a German chemist, Michael Braungart, and we've identified the two fundamental metabolisms. 
The biological one I'm sure you understand, but also the technical one, where we take materials and put them into closed cycles. 
We call them biological nutrition and technical nutrition. 
Technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition. 
Biological nutrition can supply about 500 million humans, which means that if we all wore Birkenstocks and cotton, the world would run out of cork and dry up. 
So we need materials in closed cycles, but we need to analyze them down to the parts per million for cancer, birth defects, mutagenic effects, disruption of our immune systems, biodegradation, persistence, heavy metal content, knowledge of how we're making them and their production and so on. 
Our first product was a textile where we analyzed 8,000 chemicals in the textile industry. 
Using those intellectual filters, we eliminated [7,962.] We were left with 38 chemicals. 
We have since databased the 4000 most commonly used chemicals in human manufacturing, and we're releasing this database into the public in six weeks. 
So designers all over the world can analyze their products down to the parts per million for human and ecological health. 
(Applause) We've developed a protocol so that companies can send these same messages all the way through their supply chains, because when we asked most companies we work with -- about a trillion dollars -- and say, "Where does your stuff come from?" They say, "Suppliers." 
"And where does it go?" 
"Customers." 
So we need some help there. 
So the biological nutrients, the first fabrics -- the water coming out was clean enough to drink. 
Technical nutrients -- this is for Shaw Carpet, infinitely reusable carpet. 
Here's nylon going back to caprolactam back to carpet. 
Biotechnical nutrients -- the Model U for Ford Motor, a cradle to cradle car -- concept car. 
Shoes for Nike, where the uppers are polyesters, infinitely recyclable, the bottoms are biodegradable soles. 
Wear your old shoes in, your new shoes out. 
There is no finish line. 
The idea here of the car is that some of the materials go back to the industry forever, some of the materials go back to soil -- it's all solar-powered. 
Here's a building at Oberlin College we designed that makes more energy than it needs to operate and purifies its own water. 
Here's a building for The Gap, where the ancient grasses of San Bruno, California, are on the roof. 
And this is our project for Ford Motor Company. 
It's the revitalization of the River Rouge in Dearborn. 
This is obviously a color photograph. 
These are our tools. These are how we sold it to Ford. 
We saved Ford 35 million dollars doing it this way, day one, which is the equivalent of the Ford Taurus at a four percent margin of an order for 900 million dollars worth of cars. 
Here it is. It's the world's largest green roof, 10 and a half acres. 
This is the roof, saving money, and this is the first species to arrive here. These are killdeer. 
They showed up in five days. 
And we now have 350-pound auto workers learning bird songs on the Internet. 
We're developing now protocols for cities -- that's the home of technical nutrients. 
The country -- the home of biological. And putting them together. 
And so I will finish by showing you a new city we're designing for the Chinese government. 
We're doing 12 cities for China right now, based on cradle to cradle as templates. 
Our assignment is to develop protocols for the housing for 400 million people in 12 years. 
We did a mass energy balance -- if they use brick, they will lose all their soil and burn all their coal. 
They'll have cities with no energy and no food. 
We signed a Memorandum of Understanding -- here's Madam Deng Nan, Deng Xiaoping's daughter -- for China to adopt cradle to cradle. 
Because if they toxify themselves, being the lowest-cost producer, send it to the lowest-cost distribution -- Wal-Mart -- and then we send them all our money, what we'll discover is that we have what, effectively, when I was a student, was called mutually assured destruction. 
Now we do it by molecule. These are our cities. 
We're building a new city next to this city; look at that landscape. 
This is the site. 
We don't normally do green fields, but this one is about to be built, so they brought us in to intercede. 
This is their plan. 
It's a rubber stamp grid that they laid right on that landscape. 
And they brought us in and said, "What would you do?" 
This is what they would end up with, which is another color photograph. 
So this is the existing site, so this is what it looks like now, and here's our proposal. 
(Applause) So the way we approached this is we studied the hydrology very carefully. 
We studied the biota, the ancient biota, the current farming and the protocols. 
We studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the city will have fresh air, fresh water and direct sunlight in every single apartment at some point during the day. 
We then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure. 
We lay out the building areas. 
We start to integrate commercial and mixed use so the people all have centers and places to be. 
The transportation is all very simple, everybody's within a five-minute walk of mobility. 
We have a 24-hour street, so that there's always a place that's alive. 
The waste systems all connect. 
If you flush a toilet, your feces will go to the sewage treatment plants, which are sold as assets, not liabilities. 
Because who wants the fertilizer factory that makes natural gas? 
The waters are all taken in to construct the wetlands for habitat restorations. 
And then it makes natural gas, which then goes back into the city to power the fuel for the cooking for the city. 
So this is -- these are fertilizer gas plants. 
And then the compost is all taken back to the roofs of the city, where we've got farming, because what we've done is lifted up the city, the landscape, into the air to -- to restore the native landscape on the roofs of the buildings. 
The solar power of all the factory centers and all the industrial zones with their light roofs powers the city. 
And this is the concept for the top of the city. 
We've lifted the earth up onto the roofs. 
The farmers have little bridges to get from one roof to the next. 
We inhabit the city with work/live space on all the ground floors. 
And so this is the existing city, and this is the new city. 
(Applause) 

So for any of us in this room today, let's start out by admitting we're lucky. 
We don't live in the world our mothers lived in, our grandmothers lived in, where career choices for women were so limited. 
And if you're in this room today, most of us grew up in a world where we have basic civil rights, and amazingly, we still live in a world where some women don't have them. 
But all that aside, we still have a problem, and it's a real problem. 
And the problem is this: Women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world. 
The numbers tell the story quite clearly.
